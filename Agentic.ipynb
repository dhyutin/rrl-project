A Comprehensive Guide\\nBody: No products in the cart.\\nHome - Hotel Guide - Can 3 People Stay In A Hotel Room? A Comprehensive Guide\\nTraveling with friends or family can be an exciting adventure, but it often comes with the challenge of finding affordable accommodation. One question that frequently arises is whether it’s possible to have three people stay in a single hotel room.\\nIf you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: In most cases, three people can stay in a standard hotel room, but it’s essential to check the hotel’s policies and room configurations.\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ins and outs of having three people share a hotel room. We’ll cover topics such as hotel policies, room types, additional fees, and tips for making the most of your stay.\\nWhether you’re planning a family vacation, a friends’ getaway, or a business trip, this article will provide you with valuable insights to help you make an informed decision.\\nWhen it comes to booking a hotel room for three people, understanding the maximum occupancy limits is crucial. Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest. Many hotels allow one child under a certain age (typically 12 or 16 years old) to stay in the same room as two adults without any additional charges.\\nHowever, if the third guest is an adult or a teenager above the specified age limit, an additional fee is usually applied.\\nIt’s worth noting that some hotels may have stricter policies, only allowing two adults per room, regardless of the age of the third guest. In such cases, you may need to book a larger room or an adjoining room to accommodate your group.\\nExpedia’s Las Vegas hotel guide highlights the importance of checking age restrictions before booking, as these policies can vary significantly between hotels and destinations.\\nWhile some hotels may allow three guests in a standard room without any additional charges (as long as one is a child), it’s more common for hotels to charge extra fees for the third person. These fees can vary widely depending on the hotel, location, and season.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, the average additional fee for a third guest ranges from $10 to $50 per night.\\nIt’s essential to factor in these additional fees when budgeting for your trip, as they can quickly add up, especially for longer stays. Some hotels may offer discounts or packages for triple occupancy, so it’s always a good idea to inquire about any special deals or promotions.\\nAdditionally, checking the hotel’s website or contacting them directly can help you understand their specific policies and fees for triple occupancy.\\n\\nWhen traveling with a group of three, finding the right hotel room can be a challenge. Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind. Most standard hotel rooms are designed for double occupancy, with two beds or a king-size bed. Accommodating a third person can make the room feel cramped and crowded, potentially compromising your overall comfort during your stay.\\nTo ensure a pleasant experience, it’s essential to evaluate the room size and layout. Some hotels offer larger rooms or suites specifically designed for triple occupancy, with additional sleeping arrangements like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, 68% of travelers prioritize room size and amenities when booking a hotel room for three or more guests. 😊\\nAdditionally, consider the purpose of your stay. If you’re traveling for leisure and plan to spend significant time in the room, having ample space to move around and relax comfortably is crucial. However, if you’re on a business trip and primarily need the room for sleeping, a more compact space might be tolerable.\\nSharing a hotel room with three people can raise privacy concerns, especially if you’re not traveling with close friends or family. Lack of personal space and the need to coordinate schedules for using shared facilities like the bathroom can be challenging.\\nIt’s essential to have open communication and establish ground rules with your roommates to respect each other’s privacy and create a harmonious environment.\\nSome hotels offer connecting rooms or suites with separate living areas, which can provide a degree of privacy while still allowing for shared spaces. However, these options often come at a higher cost.\\nIf privacy is a top priority, it might be worth considering booking separate rooms or alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or apartments.\\nWhen booking a hotel room for three people, it’s crucial to consider the amenities and facilities offered. Look for rooms with sufficient towels, toiletries, and other essentials to accommodate all guests.\\n👍 Some hotels may charge additional fees for extra amenities or roll-away beds, so be sure to inquire about these charges in advance.\\nIf you plan to spend time in the room together, check if the hotel offers amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, or coffee maker, which can enhance your overall comfort and convenience. Additionally, consider the availability of on-site restaurants, fitness centers, or recreational facilities that can accommodate your group’s needs.\\nIt’s also worth noting that some hotels have policies or restrictions on triple occupancy, so be sure to check their guidelines before booking. For example, some hotels may not allow more than two adults per room or may charge additional fees for a third person.\\nWhen three people share a hotel room, open and honest communication is the key to ensuring a harmonious stay. Before you even book the accommodation, discuss expectations and boundaries with your travel companions. What are each person’s sleep habits?\\nAre there any specific needs or preferences to consider? Establishing clear ground rules upfront can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.\\nCompromise is also essential. With three individuals in a confined space, you’ll need to be willing to make concessions and respect each other’s needs. This could mean taking turns using the bathroom in the mornings, agreeing on a reasonable noise level at night, or dividing up storage space fairly.\\nA little give-and-take can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere. After all, the memories you create together are far more important than any minor inconveniences. 😊\\nWhen sharing a hotel room with two other people, space is at a premium. That’s why packing efficiently is crucial. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, 47% of travelers cited lack of space as one of the biggest challenges of triple occupancy accommodations. To maximize the available room, consider the following tips:\\nBy packing strategically, you can minimize clutter and ensure a more comfortable stay for everyone involved.\\nIf sharing a standard hotel room with two other people seems too cramped, consider exploring alternative accommodation options. For larger groups or those seeking more privacy, Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of vacation rentals, from apartments to entire homes.\\nThese can provide more living space, separate bedrooms, and amenities like a kitchen, making them a great choice for extended stays or families.\\nAnother option is to book adjoining or connecting hotel rooms, which can offer the convenience of a traditional hotel stay while providing additional space and privacy. Many hotels, such as Marriott and Hilton, offer discounted rates for these types of room configurations, making them a cost-effective solution for groups.\\nUltimately, the success of a triple occupancy stay comes down to open communication, compromise, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. With a little planning and flexibility, you can turn what could be a challenging situation into an opportunity for bonding and making unforgettable memories with your travel companions.\\n🎉\\nStaying in a hotel room with three people can be a practical and cost-effective solution for travelers on a budget. However, it’s crucial to understand the hotel’s policies, room configurations, and potential additional fees before booking.\\nBy considering factors such as space, comfort, and privacy, you can make an informed decision that suits your travel needs and preferences.\\nRemember, open communication, compromise, and efficient packing can go a long way in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all parties involved. If triple occupancy doesn’t seem like the right fit, explore alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels.\\nUltimately, the key is to plan ahead and make the most of your travel experience, whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or with family.\\nAre you planning a stay at a Radisson Hotel and wondering about their breakfast hours?

But when you\\'re trying to make reservations for three, four or more people at a time, things get complicated.\\nThat\\'s my family\\'s reality. We don\\'t just have a couple of children — we have six kids ranging in age from 9 to 21. Having a large family doesn\\'t mean that travel is off the table, but it does mean we have to plan and search for awards in ways that are very different from those booking solo trips or romantic getaways for two.\\nThings get a little complicated if you book hotel rooms for three or four people, but it is still fairly manageable, especially if you\\'re traveling domestically. Most hotels in the United States will allow children under 18 to stay for free in a room with their parents and have occupancy that can support at least two adults and two children.\\nAs an aside, it drives me a little crazy that some hotel chains require you to enter the ages of your children when making any type of reservation when it has no impact on pricing and it slows down the whole process.\\nC\\'mon, Hyatt — why is this necessary?\\nThings get more difficult if you are traveling internationally, as many hotel rooms in Europe and other parts of the world charge more for extra occupants. Many international hotels are strict in this department and have occupancy limits that can top out at two or three people, including children.\\nI\\'ve heard horror stories from people who have not been 100% accurate on their reservations while traveling internationally. They\\'ve been forced to pay additional charges (sometimes quite hefty) to check in to the hotel. I would not mess around with the occupancy numbers at all when traveling internationally.\\nRelated: The best hotels for families you can book with points\\nWhen you add a fifth person to your hotel booking, things get more complicated, but you\\'re still often able to find standard rooms in some hotels that will fit your family, at least within the United States.\\nOne factor that may come into play is the age of your children and where they will sleep. My younger kids are fine sleeping on the floor, or we will occasionally bring sleeping bags for them, so they have the option to not share a bed with a sibling.\\nIf you are a family of five, look for hotels with the word \"suite\" in the name. Think: Candlewood Suites, Country Inn and Suites, Embassy Suites — the list goes on. You can often find standard hotel rooms that fit a family of five at properties like these, usually with two double beds and a sofa bed.\\nDifferent hotel chains have different rules on whether their suites are bookable online. With Marriott, you typically have to call to book a suite using points, while Hyatt, IHG, Hilton and Radisson will show larger rooms as bookable online.\\nI\\'ve found Hyatt to be the chain that frequently offers larger rooms at a reasonable award cost. I will generally book the standard room on points for other chains and then try to get upgraded either for free or by paying a cash co-pay. We\\'ll get to that in a minute.\\nRelated: 10 lessons from 10 years of traveling with kids\\nFor larger families, things get complicated and expensive. When my kids were younger, we may or may not have viewed occupancy limits as, well, suggestions from time to time.\\nHowever, now that the children are older, we have two main options for using our points to book hotel rooms. We can find a room in a \"suites\" hotel that sleeps eight, or we can book two rooms.\\nWe use either strategy interchangeably, depending on the hotel or the destination. For our last family trip to Nauvoo, Illinois, for example, we stayed one night at the Residence Inn Peoria in a two-bedroom suite that slept eight for 15,000 Marriott points.\\nOn the drive back, we spent two nights at the Hampton Inn Keokuk in two rooms for 10,000 Hilton Honors points per room.\\nOne thing we are always looking for when we choose to book two rooms is adjoining rooms — rooms that share a connecting door. I know many travelers don\\'t enjoy adjoining rooms because it might mean you\\'re sharing a door with a stranger, and there may be noise issues. For me, it means the difference between sharing a bed with my wife or sharing a bed with a wiggly nine-year-old.\\nWe always call and ask the hotel for adjoining rooms. While they rarely guarantee it, they usually accommodate us if they can. I have roughly a 50% to 60% success rate in securing adjoining rooms when requested, so it\\'s possible — but certainly not promised.\\nIf we have adjoining rooms, we will usually take one room for my wife and me and one room for the kids (something we don\\'t feel comfortable doing if the rooms are completely separate).\\nRelated: Why I prefer limited-service hotels over luxury chains\\nMy favorite hotel chains for larger families are the ones that comfortably accommodate our family of eight. I\\'ve had the best luck with the following:\\nThese are the chains I have found most frequently offer a suite with a door that closes the bedroom off from the rest of the hotel room. This is super important for families with young kids who have early bedtimes, since it means when the kids go to bed, everyone has to go to bed.\\nOther hotel chains with \"suite\" in the name such as Candlewood Suites, Country Inn and Suites or Embassy Suites typically have an area partially separated by a wall and aren\\'t always true suites.\\nWhile it is not the primary focus of this guide, I want to briefly mention another option for large families.\\nVacation rentals can be a smart way to book a family vacation on points. For example, Wyndham Vacation Resorts charge a flat 15,000 points per night per bedroom, and there are some good values to be had here. You can also use Marriott points to book multi-bedroom units through the Marriott Vacation Club program.\\nThough Airbnb is often touted as a great alternative for large family lodging, I have not had much success in this arena — especially compared to booking hotels on points. To find Airbnbs that fit my family of eight, I usually have very few options. And those options are often quite expensive.\\nFamily travel expert Dan Miller runs Points With a Crew. Dan and his wife have used miles and points to travel with their six kids to Puerto Rico, Sweden, Greece and more.\\nIf you have read about trying to score upgrades in Las Vegas, you\\'ve probably heard about the \"$20 trick.\" It refers to slipping the front desk agent a $20 bill with your ID and credit card when you check-in, with the hope that this tip may result in an upgrade to a suite. While I\\'ve never found much success with that particular version of the $20 trick, I\\'ve used a variation of my own to secure larger rooms.\\nMany hotel chains have big enough rooms for a large family, but they\\'re not bookable on points, even though the cash prices are not significantly higher than standard room rates. Here\\'s an example from the Staybridge Suites San Francisco, a hotel I stayed at with my family on a recent trip to California:\\nThe only room that is bookable with points is the standard one-bedroom suite. There\\'s no way to use points to book the two-bedroom suite that sleeps up to eight. In this case, I make a refundable award reservation and then e-mail the hotel (even though Richard says not to) and ask if I can pay to upgrade. I generally get one of three responses:\\nIn my experience, about 80% of the time, it\\'s the first response (free upgrade), with a relatively even split between the other two responses. If the hotel won\\'t guarantee an upgrade, I usually look for another hotel in the area that will.\\nRelated: Best credit cards for families\\nA few of my favorite amenities that I prioritize when booking hotel rooms for my family of eight includes:\\nWhen that\\'s included, that means eight meals are included for my family.\\nSeveral extended stay hotels offer an \"Evening Social\" or \"Managers Reception\" a few days per week.

A Comprehensive Guide\\nBody: No products in the cart.\\nHome - Hotel Guide - Can 3 People Stay In A Hotel Room? A Comprehensive Guide\\nTraveling with friends or family can be an exciting adventure, but it often comes with the challenge of finding affordable accommodation. One question that frequently arises is whether it’s possible to have three people stay in a single hotel room.\\nIf you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: In most cases, three people can stay in a standard hotel room, but it’s essential to check the hotel’s policies and room configurations.\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ins and outs of having three people share a hotel room. We’ll cover topics such as hotel policies, room types, additional fees, and tips for making the most of your stay.\\nWhether you’re planning a family vacation, a friends’ getaway, or a business trip, this article will provide you with valuable insights to help you make an informed decision.\\nWhen it comes to booking a hotel room for three people, understanding the maximum occupancy limits is crucial. Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest. Many hotels allow one child under a certain age (typically 12 or 16 years old) to stay in the same room as two adults without any additional charges.\\nHowever, if the third guest is an adult or a teenager above the specified age limit, an additional fee is usually applied.\\nIt’s worth noting that some hotels may have stricter policies, only allowing two adults per room, regardless of the age of the third guest. In such cases, you may need to book a larger room or an adjoining room to accommodate your group.\\nExpedia’s Las Vegas hotel guide highlights the importance of checking age restrictions before booking, as these policies can vary significantly between hotels and destinations.\\nWhile some hotels may allow three guests in a standard room without any additional charges (as long as one is a child), it’s more common for hotels to charge extra fees for the third person. These fees can vary widely depending on the hotel, location, and season.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, the average additional fee for a third guest ranges from $10 to $50 per night.\\nIt’s essential to factor in these additional fees when budgeting for your trip, as they can quickly add up, especially for longer stays. Some hotels may offer discounts or packages for triple occupancy, so it’s always a good idea to inquire about any special deals or promotions.\\nAdditionally, checking the hotel’s website or contacting them directly can help you understand their specific policies and fees for triple occupancy.\\n\\nWhen traveling with a group of three, finding the right hotel room can be a challenge. Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind. Most standard hotel rooms are designed for double occupancy, with two beds or a king-size bed. Accommodating a third person can make the room feel cramped and crowded, potentially compromising your overall comfort during your stay.\\nTo ensure a pleasant experience, it’s essential to evaluate the room size and layout. Some hotels offer larger rooms or suites specifically designed for triple occupancy, with additional sleeping arrangements like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, 68% of travelers prioritize room size and amenities when booking a hotel room for three or more guests. 😊\\nAdditionally, consider the purpose of your stay. If you’re traveling for leisure and plan to spend significant time in the room, having ample space to move around and relax comfortably is crucial. However, if you’re on a business trip and primarily need the room for sleeping, a more compact space might be tolerable.\\nSharing a hotel room with three people can raise privacy concerns, especially if you’re not traveling with close friends or family. Lack of personal space and the need to coordinate schedules for using shared facilities like the bathroom can be challenging.\\nIt’s essential to have open communication and establish ground rules with your roommates to respect each other’s privacy and create a harmonious environment.\\nSome hotels offer connecting rooms or suites with separate living areas, which can provide a degree of privacy while still allowing for shared spaces. However, these options often come at a higher cost.\\nIf privacy is a top priority, it might be worth considering booking separate rooms or alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or apartments.\\nWhen booking a hotel room for three people, it’s crucial to consider the amenities and facilities offered. Look for rooms with sufficient towels, toiletries, and other essentials to accommodate all guests.\\n👍 Some hotels may charge additional fees for extra amenities or roll-away beds, so be sure to inquire about these charges in advance.\\nIf you plan to spend time in the room together, check if the hotel offers amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, or coffee maker, which can enhance your overall comfort and convenience. Additionally, consider the availability of on-site restaurants, fitness centers, or recreational facilities that can accommodate your group’s needs.\\nIt’s also worth noting that some hotels have policies or restrictions on triple occupancy, so be sure to check their guidelines before booking. For example, some hotels may not allow more than two adults per room or may charge additional fees for a third person.\\nWhen three people share a hotel room, open and honest communication is the key to ensuring a harmonious stay. Before you even book the accommodation, discuss expectations and boundaries with your travel companions. What are each person’s sleep habits?\\nAre there any specific needs or preferences to consider? Establishing clear ground rules upfront can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.\\nCompromise is also essential. With three individuals in a confined space, you’ll need to be willing to make concessions and respect each other’s needs. This could mean taking turns using the bathroom in the mornings, agreeing on a reasonable noise level at night, or dividing up storage space fairly.\\nA little give-and-take can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere. After all, the memories you create together are far more important than any minor inconveniences. 😊\\nWhen sharing a hotel room with two other people, space is at a premium. That’s why packing efficiently is crucial. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, 47% of travelers cited lack of space as one of the biggest challenges of triple occupancy accommodations. To maximize the available room, consider the following tips:\\nBy packing strategically, you can minimize clutter and ensure a more comfortable stay for everyone involved.\\nIf sharing a standard hotel room with two other people seems too cramped, consider exploring alternative accommodation options. For larger groups or those seeking more privacy, Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of vacation rentals, from apartments to entire homes.\\nThese can provide more living space, separate bedrooms, and amenities like a kitchen, making them a great choice for extended stays or families.\\nAnother option is to book adjoining or connecting hotel rooms, which can offer the convenience of a traditional hotel stay while providing additional space and privacy. Many hotels, such as Marriott and Hilton, offer discounted rates for these types of room configurations, making them a cost-effective solution for groups.\\nUltimately, the success of a triple occupancy stay comes down to open communication, compromise, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. With a little planning and flexibility, you can turn what could be a challenging situation into an opportunity for bonding and making unforgettable memories with your travel companions.\\n🎉\\nStaying in a hotel room with three people can be a practical and cost-effective solution for travelers on a budget. However, it’s crucial to understand the hotel’s policies, room configurations, and potential additional fees before booking.\\nBy considering factors such as space, comfort, and privacy, you can make an informed decision that suits your travel needs and preferences.\\nRemember, open communication, compromise, and efficient packing can go a long way in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all parties involved. If triple occupancy doesn’t seem like the right fit, explore alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels.\\nUltimately, the key is to plan ahead and make the most of your travel experience, whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or with family.\\nAre you planning a stay at a Radisson Hotel and wondering about their breakfast hours?

But when you\\'re trying to make reservations for three, four or more people at a time, things get complicated.\\nThat\\'s my family\\'s reality. We don\\'t just have a couple of children — we have six kids ranging in age from 9 to 21. Having a large family doesn\\'t mean that travel is off the table, but it does mean we have to plan and search for awards in ways that are very different from those booking solo trips or romantic getaways for two.\\nThings get a little complicated if you book hotel rooms for three or four people, but it is still fairly manageable, especially if you\\'re traveling domestically. Most hotels in the United States will allow children under 18 to stay for free in a room with their parents and have occupancy that can support at least two adults and two children.\\nAs an aside, it drives me a little crazy that some hotel chains require you to enter the ages of your children when making any type of reservation when it has no impact on pricing and it slows down the whole process.\\nC\\'mon, Hyatt — why is this necessary?\\nThings get more difficult if you are traveling internationally, as many hotel rooms in Europe and other parts of the world charge more for extra occupants. Many international hotels are strict in this department and have occupancy limits that can top out at two or three people, including children.\\nI\\'ve heard horror stories from people who have not been 100% accurate on their reservations while traveling internationally. They\\'ve been forced to pay additional charges (sometimes quite hefty) to check in to the hotel. I would not mess around with the occupancy numbers at all when traveling internationally.\\nRelated: The best hotels for families you can book with points\\nWhen you add a fifth person to your hotel booking, things get more complicated, but you\\'re still often able to find standard rooms in some hotels that will fit your family, at least within the United States.\\nOne factor that may come into play is the age of your children and where they will sleep. My younger kids are fine sleeping on the floor, or we will occasionally bring sleeping bags for them, so they have the option to not share a bed with a sibling.\\nIf you are a family of five, look for hotels with the word \"suite\" in the name. Think: Candlewood Suites, Country Inn and Suites, Embassy Suites — the list goes on. You can often find standard hotel rooms that fit a family of five at properties like these, usually with two double beds and a sofa bed.\\nDifferent hotel chains have different rules on whether their suites are bookable online. With Marriott, you typically have to call to book a suite using points, while Hyatt, IHG, Hilton and Radisson will show larger rooms as bookable online.\\nI\\'ve found Hyatt to be the chain that frequently offers larger rooms at a reasonable award cost. I will generally book the standard room on points for other chains and then try to get upgraded either for free or by paying a cash co-pay. We\\'ll get to that in a minute.\\nRelated: 10 lessons from 10 years of traveling with kids\\nFor larger families, things get complicated and expensive. When my kids were younger, we may or may not have viewed occupancy limits as, well, suggestions from time to time.\\nHowever, now that the children are older, we have two main options for using our points to book hotel rooms. We can find a room in a \"suites\" hotel that sleeps eight, or we can book two rooms.\\nWe use either strategy interchangeably, depending on the hotel or the destination. For our last family trip to Nauvoo, Illinois, for example, we stayed one night at the Residence Inn Peoria in a two-bedroom suite that slept eight for 15,000 Marriott points.\\nOn the drive back, we spent two nights at the Hampton Inn Keokuk in two rooms for 10,000 Hilton Honors points per room.\\nOne thing we are always looking for when we choose to book two rooms is adjoining rooms — rooms that share a connecting door. I know many travelers don\\'t enjoy adjoining rooms because it might mean you\\'re sharing a door with a stranger, and there may be noise issues. For me, it means the difference between sharing a bed with my wife or sharing a bed with a wiggly nine-year-old.\\nWe always call and ask the hotel for adjoining rooms. While they rarely guarantee it, they usually accommodate us if they can. I have roughly a 50% to 60% success rate in securing adjoining rooms when requested, so it\\'s possible — but certainly not promised.\\nIf we have adjoining rooms, we will usually take one room for my wife and me and one room for the kids (something we don\\'t feel comfortable doing if the rooms are completely separate).\\nRelated: Why I prefer limited-service hotels over luxury chains\\nMy favorite hotel chains for larger families are the ones that comfortably accommodate our family of eight. I\\'ve had the best luck with the following:\\nThese are the chains I have found most frequently offer a suite with a door that closes the bedroom off from the rest of the hotel room. This is super important for families with young kids who have early bedtimes, since it means when the kids go to bed, everyone has to go to bed.\\nOther hotel chains with \"suite\" in the name such as Candlewood Suites, Country Inn and Suites or Embassy Suites typically have an area partially separated by a wall and aren\\'t always true suites.\\nWhile it is not the primary focus of this guide, I want to briefly mention another option for large families.\\nVacation rentals can be a smart way to book a family vacation on points. For example, Wyndham Vacation Resorts charge a flat 15,000 points per night per bedroom, and there are some good values to be had here. You can also use Marriott points to book multi-bedroom units through the Marriott Vacation Club program.\\nThough Airbnb is often touted as a great alternative for large family lodging, I have not had much success in this arena — especially compared to booking hotels on points. To find Airbnbs that fit my family of eight, I usually have very few options. And those options are often quite expensive.\\nFamily travel expert Dan Miller runs Points With a Crew. Dan and his wife have used miles and points to travel with their six kids to Puerto Rico, Sweden, Greece and more.\\nIf you have read about trying to score upgrades in Las Vegas, you\\'ve probably heard about the \"$20 trick.\" It refers to slipping the front desk agent a $20 bill with your ID and credit card when you check-in, with the hope that this tip may result in an upgrade to a suite. While I\\'ve never found much success with that particular version of the $20 trick, I\\'ve used a variation of my own to secure larger rooms.\\nMany hotel chains have big enough rooms for a large family, but they\\'re not bookable on points, even though the cash prices are not significantly higher than standard room rates. Here\\'s an example from the Staybridge Suites San Francisco, a hotel I stayed at with my family on a recent trip to California:\\nThe only room that is bookable with points is the standard one-bedroom suite. There\\'s no way to use points to book the two-bedroom suite that sleeps up to eight. In this case, I make a refundable award reservation and then e-mail the hotel (even though Richard says not to) and ask if I can pay to upgrade. I generally get one of three responses:\\nIn my experience, about 80% of the time, it\\'s the first response (free upgrade), with a relatively even split between the other two responses. If the hotel won\\'t guarantee an upgrade, I usually look for another hotel in the area that will.\\nRelated: Best credit cards for families\\nA few of my favorite amenities that I prioritize when booking hotel rooms for my family of eight includes:\\nWhen that\\'s included, that means eight meals are included for my family.\\nSeveral extended stay hotels offer an \"Evening Social\" or \"Managers Reception\" a few days per week. As long as you aren\\'t picky, this could mean a free dinner.\\nThis can help your family eat healthier meals and save on the expensive food costs typically associated with a family vacation. Of course, we\\'ve been known to cook meals in our hotel room with a rice cooker.\\nIf you\\'re staying for more than a few days, having access to laundry facilities means you don\\'t have to pack as much and can save on room in the car or airline bag fees.\\nMaximize your travel\\nThe Points Guy believes that credit cards can transform lives, helping you leverage everyday spending for cash back or travel experiences that might otherwise be out of reach.

A Comprehensive Guide\\nBody: No products in the cart.\\nHome - Hotel Guide - Can 3 People Stay In A Hotel Room? A Comprehensive Guide\\nTraveling with friends or family can be an exciting adventure, but it often comes with the challenge of finding affordable accommodation. One question that frequently arises is whether it’s possible to have three people stay in a single hotel room.\\nIf you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: In most cases, three people can stay in a standard hotel room, but it’s essential to check the hotel’s policies and room configurations.\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ins and outs of having three people share a hotel room. We’ll cover topics such as hotel policies, room types, additional fees, and tips for making the most of your stay.\\nWhether you’re planning a family vacation, a friends’ getaway, or a business trip, this article will provide you with valuable insights to help you make an informed decision.\\nWhen it comes to booking a hotel room for three people, understanding the maximum occupancy limits is crucial. Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest. Many hotels allow one child under a certain age (typically 12 or 16 years old) to stay in the same room as two adults without any additional charges.\\nHowever, if the third guest is an adult or a teenager above the specified age limit, an additional fee is usually applied.\\nIt’s worth noting that some hotels may have stricter policies, only allowing two adults per room, regardless of the age of the third guest. In such cases, you may need to book a larger room or an adjoining room to accommodate your group.\\nExpedia’s Las Vegas hotel guide highlights the importance of checking age restrictions before booking, as these policies can vary significantly between hotels and destinations.\\nWhile some hotels may allow three guests in a standard room without any additional charges (as long as one is a child), it’s more common for hotels to charge extra fees for the third person. These fees can vary widely depending on the hotel, location, and season.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, the average additional fee for a third guest ranges from $10 to $50 per night.\\nIt’s essential to factor in these additional fees when budgeting for your trip, as they can quickly add up, especially for longer stays. Some hotels may offer discounts or packages for triple occupancy, so it’s always a good idea to inquire about any special deals or promotions.\\nAdditionally, checking the hotel’s website or contacting them directly can help you understand their specific policies and fees for triple occupancy.\\n\\nWhen traveling with a group of three, finding the right hotel room can be a challenge. Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind. Most standard hotel rooms are designed for double occupancy, with two beds or a king-size bed. Accommodating a third person can make the room feel cramped and crowded, potentially compromising your overall comfort during your stay.\\nTo ensure a pleasant experience, it’s essential to evaluate the room size and layout. Some hotels offer larger rooms or suites specifically designed for triple occupancy, with additional sleeping arrangements like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, 68% of travelers prioritize room size and amenities when booking a hotel room for three or more guests. 😊\\nAdditionally, consider the purpose of your stay. If you’re traveling for leisure and plan to spend significant time in the room, having ample space to move around and relax comfortably is crucial. However, if you’re on a business trip and primarily need the room for sleeping, a more compact space might be tolerable.\\nSharing a hotel room with three people can raise privacy concerns, especially if you’re not traveling with close friends or family. Lack of personal space and the need to coordinate schedules for using shared facilities like the bathroom can be challenging.\\nIt’s essential to have open communication and establish ground rules with your roommates to respect each other’s privacy and create a harmonious environment.\\nSome hotels offer connecting rooms or suites with separate living areas, which can provide a degree of privacy while still allowing for shared spaces. However, these options often come at a higher cost.\\nIf privacy is a top priority, it might be worth considering booking separate rooms or alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or apartments.\\nWhen booking a hotel room for three people, it’s crucial to consider the amenities and facilities offered. Look for rooms with sufficient towels, toiletries, and other essentials to accommodate all guests.\\n👍 Some hotels may charge additional fees for extra amenities or roll-away beds, so be sure to inquire about these charges in advance.\\nIf you plan to spend time in the room together, check if the hotel offers amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, or coffee maker, which can enhance your overall comfort and convenience. Additionally, consider the availability of on-site restaurants, fitness centers, or recreational facilities that can accommodate your group’s needs.\\nIt’s also worth noting that some hotels have policies or restrictions on triple occupancy, so be sure to check their guidelines before booking. For example, some hotels may not allow more than two adults per room or may charge additional fees for a third person.\\nWhen three people share a hotel room, open and honest communication is the key to ensuring a harmonious stay. Before you even book the accommodation, discuss expectations and boundaries with your travel companions. What are each person’s sleep habits?\\nAre there any specific needs or preferences to consider? Establishing clear ground rules upfront can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.\\nCompromise is also essential. With three individuals in a confined space, you’ll need to be willing to make concessions and respect each other’s needs. This could mean taking turns using the bathroom in the mornings, agreeing on a reasonable noise level at night, or dividing up storage space fairly.\\nA little give-and-take can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere. After all, the memories you create together are far more important than any minor inconveniences. 😊\\nWhen sharing a hotel room with two other people, space is at a premium. That’s why packing efficiently is crucial. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, 47% of travelers cited lack of space as one of the biggest challenges of triple occupancy accommodations. To maximize the available room, consider the following tips:\\nBy packing strategically, you can minimize clutter and ensure a more comfortable stay for everyone involved.\\nIf sharing a standard hotel room with two other people seems too cramped, consider exploring alternative accommodation options. For larger groups or those seeking more privacy, Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of vacation rentals, from apartments to entire homes.\\nThese can provide more living space, separate bedrooms, and amenities like a kitchen, making them a great choice for extended stays or families.\\nAnother option is to book adjoining or connecting hotel rooms, which can offer the convenience of a traditional hotel stay while providing additional space and privacy. Many hotels, such as Marriott and Hilton, offer discounted rates for these types of room configurations, making them a cost-effective solution for groups.\\nUltimately, the success of a triple occupancy stay comes down to open communication, compromise, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. With a little planning and flexibility, you can turn what could be a challenging situation into an opportunity for bonding and making unforgettable memories with your travel companions.\\n🎉\\nStaying in a hotel room with three people can be a practical and cost-effective solution for travelers on a budget. However, it’s crucial to understand the hotel’s policies, room configurations, and potential additional fees before booking.\\nBy considering factors such as space, comfort, and privacy, you can make an informed decision that suits your travel needs and preferences.\\nRemember, open communication, compromise, and efficient packing can go a long way in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all parties involved. If triple occupancy doesn’t seem like the right fit, explore alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels.\\nUltimately, the key is to plan ahead and make the most of your travel experience, whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or with family.\\nAre you planning a stay at a Radisson Hotel and wondering about their breakfast hours?

But when you\\'re trying to make reservations for three, four or more people at a time, things get complicated.\\nThat\\'s my family\\'s reality. We don\\'t just have a couple of children — we have six kids ranging in age from 9 to 21. Having a large family doesn\\'t mean that travel is off the table, but it does mean we have to plan and search for awards in ways that are very different from those booking solo trips or romantic getaways for two.\\nThings get a little complicated if you book hotel rooms for three or four people, but it is still fairly manageable, especially if you\\'re traveling domestically. Most hotels in the United States will allow children under 18 to stay for free in a room with their parents and have occupancy that can support at least two adults and two children.\\nAs an aside, it drives me a little crazy that some hotel chains require you to enter the ages of your children when making any type of reservation when it has no impact on pricing and it slows down the whole process.\\nC\\'mon, Hyatt — why is this necessary?\\nThings get more difficult if you are traveling internationally, as many hotel rooms in Europe and other parts of the world charge more for extra occupants. Many international hotels are strict in this department and have occupancy limits that can top out at two or three people, including children.\\nI\\'ve heard horror stories from people who have not been 100% accurate on their reservations while traveling internationally. They\\'ve been forced to pay additional charges (sometimes quite hefty) to check in to the hotel. I would not mess around with the occupancy numbers at all when traveling internationally.\\nRelated: The best hotels for families you can book with points\\nWhen you add a fifth person to your hotel booking, things get more complicated, but you\\'re still often able to find standard rooms in some hotels that will fit your family, at least within the United States.\\nOne factor that may come into play is the age of your children and where they will sleep. My younger kids are fine sleeping on the floor, or we will occasionally bring sleeping bags for them, so they have the option to not share a bed with a sibling.\\nIf you are a family of five, look for hotels with the word \"suite\" in the name. Think: Candlewood Suites, Country Inn and Suites, Embassy Suites — the list goes on. You can often find standard hotel rooms that fit a family of five at properties like these, usually with two double beds and a sofa bed.\\nDifferent hotel chains have different rules on whether their suites are bookable online. With Marriott, you typically have to call to book a suite using points, while Hyatt, IHG, Hilton and Radisson will show larger rooms as bookable online.\\nI\\'ve found Hyatt to be the chain that frequently offers larger rooms at a reasonable award cost. I will generally book the standard room on points for other chains and then try to get upgraded either for free or by paying a cash co-pay. We\\'ll get to that in a minute.\\nRelated: 10 lessons from 10 years of traveling with kids\\nFor larger families, things get complicated and expensive. When my kids were younger, we may or may not have viewed occupancy limits as, well, suggestions from time to time.\\nHowever, now that the children are older, we have two main options for using our points to book hotel rooms. We can find a room in a \"suites\" hotel that sleeps eight, or we can book two rooms.\\nWe use either strategy interchangeably, depending on the hotel or the destination. For our last family trip to Nauvoo, Illinois, for example, we stayed one night at the Residence Inn Peoria in a two-bedroom suite that slept eight for 15,000 Marriott points.\\nOn the drive back, we spent two nights at the Hampton Inn Keokuk in two rooms for 10,000 Hilton Honors points per room.\\nOne thing we are always looking for when we choose to book two rooms is adjoining rooms — rooms that share a connecting door. I know many travelers don\\'t enjoy adjoining rooms because it might mean you\\'re sharing a door with a stranger, and there may be noise issues. For me, it means the difference between sharing a bed with my wife or sharing a bed with a wiggly nine-year-old.\\nWe always call and ask the hotel for adjoining rooms. While they rarely guarantee it, they usually accommodate us if they can. I have roughly a 50% to 60% success rate in securing adjoining rooms when requested, so it\\'s possible — but certainly not promised.\\nIf we have adjoining rooms, we will usually take one room for my wife and me and one room for the kids (something we don\\'t feel comfortable doing if the rooms are completely separate).\\nRelated: Why I prefer limited-service hotels over luxury chains\\nMy favorite hotel chains for larger families are the ones that comfortably accommodate our family of eight. I\\'ve had the best luck with the following:\\nThese are the chains I have found most frequently offer a suite with a door that closes the bedroom off from the rest of the hotel room. This is super important for families with young kids who have early bedtimes, since it means when the kids go to bed, everyone has to go to bed.\\nOther hotel chains with \"suite\" in the name such as Candlewood Suites, Country Inn and Suites or Embassy Suites typically have an area partially separated by a wall and aren\\'t always true suites.\\nWhile it is not the primary focus of this guide, I want to briefly mention another option for large families.\\nVacation rentals can be a smart way to book a family vacation on points. For example, Wyndham Vacation Resorts charge a flat 15,000 points per night per bedroom, and there are some good values to be had here. You can also use Marriott points to book multi-bedroom units through the Marriott Vacation Club program.\\nThough Airbnb is often touted as a great alternative for large family lodging, I have not had much success in this arena — especially compared to booking hotels on points. To find Airbnbs that fit my family of eight, I usually have very few options. And those options are often quite expensive.\\nFamily travel expert Dan Miller runs Points With a Crew. Dan and his wife have used miles and points to travel with their six kids to Puerto Rico, Sweden, Greece and more.\\nIf you have read about trying to score upgrades in Las Vegas, you\\'ve probably heard about the \"$20 trick.\" It refers to slipping the front desk agent a $20 bill with your ID and credit card when you check-in, with the hope that this tip may result in an upgrade to a suite. While I\\'ve never found much success with that particular version of the $20 trick, I\\'ve used a variation of my own to secure larger rooms.\\nMany hotel chains have big enough rooms for a large family, but they\\'re not bookable on points, even though the cash prices are not significantly higher than standard room rates. Here\\'s an example from the Staybridge Suites San Francisco, a hotel I stayed at with my family on a recent trip to California:\\nThe only room that is bookable with points is the standard one-bedroom suite. There\\'s no way to use points to book the two-bedroom suite that sleeps up to eight. In this case, I make a refundable award reservation and then e-mail the hotel (even though Richard says not to) and ask if I can pay to upgrade. I generally get one of three responses:\\nIn my experience, about 80% of the time, it\\'s the first response (free upgrade), with a relatively even split between the other two responses. If the hotel won\\'t guarantee an upgrade, I usually look for another hotel in the area that will.\\nRelated: Best credit cards for families\\nA few of my favorite amenities that I prioritize when booking hotel rooms for my family of eight includes:\\nWhen that\\'s included, that means eight meals are included for my family.\\nSeveral extended stay hotels offer an \"Evening Social\" or \"Managers Reception\" a few days per week. As long as you aren\\'t picky, this could mean a free dinner.\\nThis can help your family eat healthier meals and save on the expensive food costs typically associated with a family vacation. Of course, we\\'ve been known to cook meals in our hotel room with a rice cooker.\\nIf you\\'re staying for more than a few days, having access to laundry facilities means you don\\'t have to pack as much and can save on room in the car or airline bag fees.\\nMaximize your travel\\nThe Points Guy believes that credit cards can transform lives, helping you leverage everyday spending for cash back or travel experiences that might otherwise be out of reach.

A Comprehensive Guide\\nBody: No products in the cart.\\nHome - Hotel Guide - Can 3 People Stay In A Hotel Room? A Comprehensive Guide\\nTraveling with friends or family can be an exciting adventure, but it often comes with the challenge of finding affordable accommodation. One question that frequently arises is whether it’s possible to have three people stay in a single hotel room.\\nIf you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: In most cases, three people can stay in a standard hotel room, but it’s essential to check the hotel’s policies and room configurations.\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ins and outs of having three people share a hotel room. We’ll cover topics such as hotel policies, room types, additional fees, and tips for making the most of your stay.\\nWhether you’re planning a family vacation, a friends’ getaway, or a business trip, this article will provide you with valuable insights to help you make an informed decision.\\nWhen it comes to booking a hotel room for three people, understanding the maximum occupancy limits is crucial. Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest. Many hotels allow one child under a certain age (typically 12 or 16 years old) to stay in the same room as two adults without any additional charges.\\nHowever, if the third guest is an adult or a teenager above the specified age limit, an additional fee is usually applied.\\nIt’s worth noting that some hotels may have stricter policies, only allowing two adults per room, regardless of the age of the third guest. In such cases, you may need to book a larger room or an adjoining room to accommodate your group.\\nExpedia’s Las Vegas hotel guide highlights the importance of checking age restrictions before booking, as these policies can vary significantly between hotels and destinations.\\nWhile some hotels may allow three guests in a standard room without any additional charges (as long as one is a child), it’s more common for hotels to charge extra fees for the third person. These fees can vary widely depending on the hotel, location, and season.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, the average additional fee for a third guest ranges from $10 to $50 per night.\\nIt’s essential to factor in these additional fees when budgeting for your trip, as they can quickly add up, especially for longer stays. Some hotels may offer discounts or packages for triple occupancy, so it’s always a good idea to inquire about any special deals or promotions.\\nAdditionally, checking the hotel’s website or contacting them directly can help you understand their specific policies and fees for triple occupancy.\\n\\nWhen traveling with a group of three, finding the right hotel room can be a challenge. Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind. Most standard hotel rooms are designed for double occupancy, with two beds or a king-size bed. Accommodating a third person can make the room feel cramped and crowded, potentially compromising your overall comfort during your stay.\\nTo ensure a pleasant experience, it’s essential to evaluate the room size and layout. Some hotels offer larger rooms or suites specifically designed for triple occupancy, with additional sleeping arrangements like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, 68% of travelers prioritize room size and amenities when booking a hotel room for three or more guests. 😊\\nAdditionally, consider the purpose of your stay. If you’re traveling for leisure and plan to spend significant time in the room, having ample space to move around and relax comfortably is crucial. However, if you’re on a business trip and primarily need the room for sleeping, a more compact space might be tolerable.\\nSharing a hotel room with three people can raise privacy concerns, especially if you’re not traveling with close friends or family. Lack of personal space and the need to coordinate schedules for using shared facilities like the bathroom can be challenging.\\nIt’s essential to have open communication and establish ground rules with your roommates to respect each other’s privacy and create a harmonious environment.\\nSome hotels offer connecting rooms or suites with separate living areas, which can provide a degree of privacy while still allowing for shared spaces. However, these options often come at a higher cost.\\nIf privacy is a top priority, it might be worth considering booking separate rooms or alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or apartments.\\nWhen booking a hotel room for three people, it’s crucial to consider the amenities and facilities offered. Look for rooms with sufficient towels, toiletries, and other essentials to accommodate all guests.\\n👍 Some hotels may charge additional fees for extra amenities or roll-away beds, so be sure to inquire about these charges in advance.\\nIf you plan to spend time in the room together, check if the hotel offers amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, or coffee maker, which can enhance your overall comfort and convenience. Additionally, consider the availability of on-site restaurants, fitness centers, or recreational facilities that can accommodate your group’s needs.\\nIt’s also worth noting that some hotels have policies or restrictions on triple occupancy, so be sure to check their guidelines before booking. For example, some hotels may not allow more than two adults per room or may charge additional fees for a third person.\\nWhen three people share a hotel room, open and honest communication is the key to ensuring a harmonious stay. Before you even book the accommodation, discuss expectations and boundaries with your travel companions. What are each person’s sleep habits?\\nAre there any specific needs or preferences to consider? Establishing clear ground rules upfront can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.\\nCompromise is also essential. With three individuals in a confined space, you’ll need to be willing to make concessions and respect each other’s needs. This could mean taking turns using the bathroom in the mornings, agreeing on a reasonable noise level at night, or dividing up storage space fairly.\\nA little give-and-take can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere. After all, the memories you create together are far more important than any minor inconveniences. 😊\\nWhen sharing a hotel room with two other people, space is at a premium. That’s why packing efficiently is crucial. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, 47% of travelers cited lack of space as one of the biggest challenges of triple occupancy accommodations. To maximize the available room, consider the following tips:\\nBy packing strategically, you can minimize clutter and ensure a more comfortable stay for everyone involved.\\nIf sharing a standard hotel room with two other people seems too cramped, consider exploring alternative accommodation options. For larger groups or those seeking more privacy, Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of vacation rentals, from apartments to entire homes.\\nThese can provide more living space, separate bedrooms, and amenities like a kitchen, making them a great choice for extended stays or families.\\nAnother option is to book adjoining or connecting hotel rooms, which can offer the convenience of a traditional hotel stay while providing additional space and privacy. Many hotels, such as Marriott and Hilton, offer discounted rates for these types of room configurations, making them a cost-effective solution for groups.\\nUltimately, the success of a triple occupancy stay comes down to open communication, compromise, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. With a little planning and flexibility, you can turn what could be a challenging situation into an opportunity for bonding and making unforgettable memories with your travel companions.\\n🎉\\nStaying in a hotel room with three people can be a practical and cost-effective solution for travelers on a budget. However, it’s crucial to understand the hotel’s policies, room configurations, and potential additional fees before booking.\\nBy considering factors such as space, comfort, and privacy, you can make an informed decision that suits your travel needs and preferences.\\nRemember, open communication, compromise, and efficient packing can go a long way in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all parties involved. If triple occupancy doesn’t seem like the right fit, explore alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels.\\nUltimately, the key is to plan ahead and make the most of your travel experience, whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or with family.\\nAre you planning a stay at a Radisson Hotel and wondering about their breakfast hours?

But when you\\'re trying to make reservations for three, four or more people at a time, things get complicated.\\nThat\\'s my family\\'s reality. We don\\'t just have a couple of children — we have six kids ranging in age from 9 to 21. Having a large family doesn\\'t mean that travel is off the table, but it does mean we have to plan and search for awards in ways that are very different from those booking solo trips or romantic getaways for two.\\nThings get a little complicated if you book hotel rooms for three or four people, but it is still fairly manageable, especially if you\\'re traveling domestically. Most hotels in the United States will allow children under 18 to stay for free in a room with their parents and have occupancy that can support at least two adults and two children.\\nAs an aside, it drives me a little crazy that some hotel chains require you to enter the ages of your children when making any type of reservation when it has no impact on pricing and it slows down the whole process.\\nC\\'mon, Hyatt — why is this necessary?\\nThings get more difficult if you are traveling internationally, as many hotel rooms in Europe and other parts of the world charge more for extra occupants. Many international hotels are strict in this department and have occupancy limits that can top out at two or three people, including children.\\nI\\'ve heard horror stories from people who have not been 100% accurate on their reservations while traveling internationally. They\\'ve been forced to pay additional charges (sometimes quite hefty) to check in to the hotel. I would not mess around with the occupancy numbers at all when traveling internationally.\\nRelated: The best hotels for families you can book with points\\nWhen you add a fifth person to your hotel booking, things get more complicated, but you\\'re still often able to find standard rooms in some hotels that will fit your family, at least within the United States.\\nOne factor that may come into play is the age of your children and where they will sleep. My younger kids are fine sleeping on the floor, or we will occasionally bring sleeping bags for them, so they have the option to not share a bed with a sibling.\\nIf you are a family of five, look for hotels with the word \"suite\" in the name. Think: Candlewood Suites, Country Inn and Suites, Embassy Suites — the list goes on. You can often find standard hotel rooms that fit a family of five at properties like these, usually with two double beds and a sofa bed.\\nDifferent hotel chains have different rules on whether their suites are bookable online. With Marriott, you typically have to call to book a suite using points, while Hyatt, IHG, Hilton and Radisson will show larger rooms as bookable online.\\nI\\'ve found Hyatt to be the chain that frequently offers larger rooms at a reasonable award cost. I will generally book the standard room on points for other chains and then try to get upgraded either for free or by paying a cash co-pay. We\\'ll get to that in a minute.\\nRelated: 10 lessons from 10 years of traveling with kids\\nFor larger families, things get complicated and expensive. When my kids were younger, we may or may not have viewed occupancy limits as, well, suggestions from time to time.\\nHowever, now that the children are older, we have two main options for using our points to book hotel rooms. We can find a room in a \"suites\" hotel that sleeps eight, or we can book two rooms.\\nWe use either strategy interchangeably, depending on the hotel or the destination. For our last family trip to Nauvoo, Illinois, for example, we stayed one night at the Residence Inn Peoria in a two-bedroom suite that slept eight for 15,000 Marriott points.\\nOn the drive back, we spent two nights at the Hampton Inn Keokuk in two rooms for 10,000 Hilton Honors points per room.\\nOne thing we are always looking for when we choose to book two rooms is adjoining rooms — rooms that share a connecting door. I know many travelers don\\'t enjoy adjoining rooms because it might mean you\\'re sharing a door with a stranger, and there may be noise issues. For me, it means the difference between sharing a bed with my wife or sharing a bed with a wiggly nine-year-old.\\nWe always call and ask the hotel for adjoining rooms. While they rarely guarantee it, they usually accommodate us if they can. I have roughly a 50% to 60% success rate in securing adjoining rooms when requested, so it\\'s possible — but certainly not promised.\\nIf we have adjoining rooms, we will usually take one room for my wife and me and one room for the kids (something we don\\'t feel comfortable doing if the rooms are completely separate).\\nRelated: Why I prefer limited-service hotels over luxury chains\\nMy favorite hotel chains for larger families are the ones that comfortably accommodate our family of eight. I\\'ve had the best luck with the following:\\nThese are the chains I have found most frequently offer a suite with a door that closes the bedroom off from the rest of the hotel room. This is super important for families with young kids who have early bedtimes, since it means when the kids go to bed, everyone has to go to bed.\\nOther hotel chains with \"suite\" in the name such as Candlewood Suites, Country Inn and Suites or Embassy Suites typically have an area partially separated by a wall and aren\\'t always true suites.\\nWhile it is not the primary focus of this guide, I want to briefly mention another option for large families.\\nVacation rentals can be a smart way to book a family vacation on points. For example, Wyndham Vacation Resorts charge a flat 15,000 points per night per bedroom, and there are some good values to be had here. You can also use Marriott points to book multi-bedroom units through the Marriott Vacation Club program.\\nThough Airbnb is often touted as a great alternative for large family lodging, I have not had much success in this arena — especially compared to booking hotels on points. To find Airbnbs that fit my family of eight, I usually have very few options. And those options are often quite expensive.\\nFamily travel expert Dan Miller runs Points With a Crew. Dan and his wife have used miles and points to travel with their six kids to Puerto Rico, Sweden, Greece and more.\\nIf you have read about trying to score upgrades in Las Vegas, you\\'ve probably heard about the \"$20 trick.\" It refers to slipping the front desk agent a $20 bill with your ID and credit card when you check-in, with the hope that this tip may result in an upgrade to a suite. While I\\'ve never found much success with that particular version of the $20 trick, I\\'ve used a variation of my own to secure larger rooms.\\nMany hotel chains have big enough rooms for a large family, but they\\'re not bookable on points, even though the cash prices are not significantly higher than standard room rates. Here\\'s an example from the Staybridge Suites San Francisco, a hotel I stayed at with my family on a recent trip to California:\\nThe only room that is bookable with points is the standard one-bedroom suite. There\\'s no way to use points to book the two-bedroom suite that sleeps up to eight. In this case, I make a refundable award reservation and then e-mail the hotel (even though Richard says not to) and ask if I can pay to upgrade. I generally get one of three responses:\\nIn my experience, about 80% of the time, it\\'s the first response (free upgrade), with a relatively even split between the other two responses. If the hotel won\\'t guarantee an upgrade, I usually look for another hotel in the area that will.\\nRelated: Best credit cards for families\\nA few of my favorite amenities that I prioritize when booking hotel rooms for my family of eight includes:\\nWhen that\\'s included, that means eight meals are included for my family.\\nSeveral extended stay hotels offer an \"Evening Social\" or \"Managers Reception\" a few days per week. As long as you aren\\'t picky, this could mean a free dinner.\\nThis can help your family eat healthier meals and save on the expensive food costs typically associated with a family vacation. Of course, we\\'ve been known to cook meals in our hotel room with a rice cooker.\\nIf you\\'re staying for more than a few days, having access to laundry facilities means you don\\'t have to pack as much and can save on room in the car or airline bag fees.\\nMaximize your travel\\nThe Points Guy believes that credit cards can transform lives, helping you leverage everyday spending for cash back or travel experiences that might otherwise be out of reach.

A Comprehensive Guide\\nBody: No products in the cart.\\nHome - Hotel Guide - Can 3 People Stay In A Hotel Room? A Comprehensive Guide\\nTraveling with friends or family can be an exciting adventure, but it often comes with the challenge of finding affordable accommodation. One question that frequently arises is whether it’s possible to have three people stay in a single hotel room.\\nIf you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: In most cases, three people can stay in a standard hotel room, but it’s essential to check the hotel’s policies and room configurations.\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ins and outs of having three people share a hotel room. We’ll cover topics such as hotel policies, room types, additional fees, and tips for making the most of your stay.\\nWhether you’re planning a family vacation, a friends’ getaway, or a business trip, this article will provide you with valuable insights to help you make an informed decision.\\nWhen it comes to booking a hotel room for three people, understanding the maximum occupancy limits is crucial. Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest. Many hotels allow one child under a certain age (typically 12 or 16 years old) to stay in the same room as two adults without any additional charges.\\nHowever, if the third guest is an adult or a teenager above the specified age limit, an additional fee is usually applied.\\nIt’s worth noting that some hotels may have stricter policies, only allowing two adults per room, regardless of the age of the third guest. In such cases, you may need to book a larger room or an adjoining room to accommodate your group.\\nExpedia’s Las Vegas hotel guide highlights the importance of checking age restrictions before booking, as these policies can vary significantly between hotels and destinations.\\nWhile some hotels may allow three guests in a standard room without any additional charges (as long as one is a child), it’s more common for hotels to charge extra fees for the third person. These fees can vary widely depending on the hotel, location, and season.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, the average additional fee for a third guest ranges from $10 to $50 per night.\\nIt’s essential to factor in these additional fees when budgeting for your trip, as they can quickly add up, especially for longer stays. Some hotels may offer discounts or packages for triple occupancy, so it’s always a good idea to inquire about any special deals or promotions.\\nAdditionally, checking the hotel’s website or contacting them directly can help you understand their specific policies and fees for triple occupancy.\\n\\nWhen traveling with a group of three, finding the right hotel room can be a challenge. Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind. Most standard hotel rooms are designed for double occupancy, with two beds or a king-size bed. Accommodating a third person can make the room feel cramped and crowded, potentially compromising your overall comfort during your stay.\\nTo ensure a pleasant experience, it’s essential to evaluate the room size and layout. Some hotels offer larger rooms or suites specifically designed for triple occupancy, with additional sleeping arrangements like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, 68% of travelers prioritize room size and amenities when booking a hotel room for three or more guests. 😊\\nAdditionally, consider the purpose of your stay. If you’re traveling for leisure and plan to spend significant time in the room, having ample space to move around and relax comfortably is crucial. However, if you’re on a business trip and primarily need the room for sleeping, a more compact space might be tolerable.\\nSharing a hotel room with three people can raise privacy concerns, especially if you’re not traveling with close friends or family. Lack of personal space and the need to coordinate schedules for using shared facilities like the bathroom can be challenging.\\nIt’s essential to have open communication and establish ground rules with your roommates to respect each other’s privacy and create a harmonious environment.\\nSome hotels offer connecting rooms or suites with separate living areas, which can provide a degree of privacy while still allowing for shared spaces. However, these options often come at a higher cost.\\nIf privacy is a top priority, it might be worth considering booking separate rooms or alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or apartments.\\nWhen booking a hotel room for three people, it’s crucial to consider the amenities and facilities offered. Look for rooms with sufficient towels, toiletries, and other essentials to accommodate all guests.\\n👍 Some hotels may charge additional fees for extra amenities or roll-away beds, so be sure to inquire about these charges in advance.\\nIf you plan to spend time in the room together, check if the hotel offers amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, or coffee maker, which can enhance your overall comfort and convenience. Additionally, consider the availability of on-site restaurants, fitness centers, or recreational facilities that can accommodate your group’s needs.\\nIt’s also worth noting that some hotels have policies or restrictions on triple occupancy, so be sure to check their guidelines before booking. For example, some hotels may not allow more than two adults per room or may charge additional fees for a third person.\\nWhen three people share a hotel room, open and honest communication is the key to ensuring a harmonious stay. Before you even book the accommodation, discuss expectations and boundaries with your travel companions. What are each person’s sleep habits?\\nAre there any specific needs or preferences to consider? Establishing clear ground rules upfront can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.\\nCompromise is also essential. With three individuals in a confined space, you’ll need to be willing to make concessions and respect each other’s needs. This could mean taking turns using the bathroom in the mornings, agreeing on a reasonable noise level at night, or dividing up storage space fairly.\\nA little give-and-take can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere. After all, the memories you create together are far more important than any minor inconveniences. 😊\\nWhen sharing a hotel room with two other people, space is at a premium. That’s why packing efficiently is crucial. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, 47% of travelers cited lack of space as one of the biggest challenges of triple occupancy accommodations. To maximize the available room, consider the following tips:\\nBy packing strategically, you can minimize clutter and ensure a more comfortable stay for everyone involved.\\nIf sharing a standard hotel room with two other people seems too cramped, consider exploring alternative accommodation options. For larger groups or those seeking more privacy, Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of vacation rentals, from apartments to entire homes.\\nThese can provide more living space, separate bedrooms, and amenities like a kitchen, making them a great choice for extended stays or families.\\nAnother option is to book adjoining or connecting hotel rooms, which can offer the convenience of a traditional hotel stay while providing additional space and privacy. Many hotels, such as Marriott and Hilton, offer discounted rates for these types of room configurations, making them a cost-effective solution for groups.\\nUltimately, the success of a triple occupancy stay comes down to open communication, compromise, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. With a little planning and flexibility, you can turn what could be a challenging situation into an opportunity for bonding and making unforgettable memories with your travel companions.\\n🎉\\nStaying in a hotel room with three people can be a practical and cost-effective solution for travelers on a budget. However, it’s crucial to understand the hotel’s policies, room configurations, and potential additional fees before booking.\\nBy considering factors such as space, comfort, and privacy, you can make an informed decision that suits your travel needs and preferences.\\nRemember, open communication, compromise, and efficient packing can go a long way in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all parties involved. If triple occupancy doesn’t seem like the right fit, explore alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels.\\nUltimately, the key is to plan ahead and make the most of your travel experience, whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or with family.\\nAre you planning a stay at a Radisson Hotel and wondering about their breakfast hours?

My wife, 21-year old daughter, and I are traveling to Rome, Florence, and Venice.  A few hotels make it obvious but many do not.  If I plug in three people on the hotels website it still only shows one bed and no mention of a roll-away, or couch that folds into a bed.  Do I assume an additional bed will be provided, or are they telling me three people are expected to sleep in one bed? \\nAny tips or insight? \\nA 3-bed room is unusual, rooms are single or double. A normal double room will not have enough spare space to add a third bed.\\nAn adult child sleeping with their parents would be regarded as unusual. Family rooms are child sized beds.\\nI suggest booking one double and one single room you would have more success.\\nWe had a triple at the Hotel Diplomatic in Rome. It consisted of two twin beds pushed together and a third, single bed, in the corner. It was pretty tight but manageable. \\nFor my upcoming July trip I found triple rooms at:\\nVenice-Hotel Ala \\nFlorence- Alba Palace\\nSiena- CAMPO REGIO RELAIS(I believe the 3rd bed here is a sleeper sofa type\\nRome-Albergo Del Senato\\nAs a recall I had to scroll down lists to find a triple room.\\nWe are traveling with our 14yo daughter.\\nHope that helps!\\nOnly way to know is either the room is labeled a triple, or to ask the hotel specifically. You can’t assume room for 3. Triples, or doubles with the option of a rollaway bed brought in, do exist but as you are finding they are somewhat rare. \\nBooking a single and a double is an option with an adult child. Or Apartment rentals are often cheaper than 2 rooms or a triple room, and have more space/privacy. It’s what I do with 2 pre-teens as 2 separate rooms is not an option and rooms for 4 are even rarer than for 3. \\nI don’t find it particularly difficult to find triple rooms. But if you need a suggestion for a Rome hotel that does have triple rooms then look at the Hotel Napoleon. They definitely do have triple rooms.\\nI\\'ve stayed in a triple room twice at Hotel Casci in Florence. Great location, nice rooms. I do understand that the family that ran Casci for years sold it a year or two ago, so you would need to check that they continue to offer triple (and at least one quad) rooms.\\nMy wife and I traveled through many countries in Europe with our teenage daughter.  We used both Booking.com and directly through hotel websites.  Now also Airbnb.  Always put in 1 room for 3 people in your searches.  Most hotels will not have what you want.  Do not assume anything.  If the results do not specifically say triple room, or three single beds, or one double bed plus one single bed do not book it.\\nWe always found nice accommodation.  Rick Steves guidebooks often list hotel’s with triple rooms and even quadruple rooms, but not every hotel has these larger rooms.  Some  hotels have 30 double rooms but only 1 or 2 triples.  \\nKeep looking and you’ll find something.  If there is a hotel you really really like just them send an email first to clarify the situation before you book.\\nIf you find a hotel you like and their website is ambiguous regarding the bed arrangements for three people, e-mail them directly and ask.\\nAs said above, triples are not as common in Italy as in the US, but they do exist. They may be have one bed for two and a bed for one, or may have three single beds. How much space is left in the room other than the beds is also quite variable; if they\\'ve made a \"triple\" by shoe-horning an extra bed into a double room, you may not have enough room to walk around.\\nIf you\\'re not able to find a suitable triple, you can get a single and a double, as said above. This also has the advantage of two bathrooms instead of one - nice anytime, and particularly handy for early departures.\\nTHANK YOU to everyone! I really appreciate all your input. \\nIf you book a room for three people, it will have three beds.  Sometimes three singles and sometimes a double and a single.  What you cannot do is book a double room and expect to find two double beds that can be used by three people.  In Europe it is more common to be charged per person rather than just being charge for a room as is common in the US.\\nIn Europe it is more common to be charged per person rather than just being charge for a room as is common in the US.\\nI believe this is a legal requirement not just an unfamiliar (to us) hotel policy issue.\\nIn Florence, room #6 at Hotel Il Bargellino is set up to meet your needs. It has one full size bed, one single bed and a good-sized ensuite bath. The room is larger than a lot of Italian hotel rooms, so not cramped for 3 people. Price is probably around 100 euro per night.\\nDon\\'t assume anything. Rooms are generally much smaller than what we might expect in the US. I can second the comment about Booking.com. We have used it on many trips around Europe. Just go for a place rated 9.0 or better.

Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest.

Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind. Most standard hotel rooms are designed for double occupancy, with two beds or a king-size bed. Accommodating a third person can make the room feel cramped and crowded, potentially compromising your overall comfort during your stay.\\nTo ensure a pleasant experience, it’s essential to evaluate the room size and layout. Some hotels offer larger rooms or suites specifically designed for triple occupancy, with additional sleeping arrangements like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, 68% of travelers prioritize room size and amenities when booking a hotel room for three or more guests. 😊\\nAdditionally, consider the purpose of your stay. If you’re traveling for leisure and plan to spend significant time in the room, having ample space to move around and relax comfortably is crucial. However, if you’re on a business trip and primarily need the room for sleeping, a more compact space might be tolerable.\\nSharing a hotel room with three people can raise privacy concerns, especially if you’re not traveling with close friends or family. Lack of personal space and the need to coordinate schedules for using shared facilities like the bathroom can be challenging.\\nIt’s essential to have open communication and establish ground rules with your roommates to respect each other’s privacy and create a harmonious environment.\\nSome hotels offer connecting rooms or suites with separate living areas, which can provide a degree of privacy while still allowing for shared spaces. However, these options often come at a higher cost.\\nIf privacy is a top priority, it might be worth considering booking separate rooms or alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or apartments.\\nWhen booking a hotel room for three people, it’s crucial to consider the amenities and facilities offered. Look for rooms with sufficient towels, toiletries, and other essentials to accommodate all guests.\\n👍 Some hotels may charge additional fees for extra amenities or roll-away beds, so be sure to inquire about these charges in advance.\\nIf you plan to spend time in the room together, check if the hotel offers amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, or coffee maker, which can enhance your overall comfort and convenience. Additionally, consider the availability of on-site restaurants, fitness centers, or recreational facilities that can accommodate your group’s needs.\\nIt’s also worth noting that some hotels have policies or restrictions on triple occupancy, so be sure to check their guidelines before booking. For example, some hotels may not allow more than two adults per room or may charge additional fees for a third person.\\nWhen three people share a hotel room, open and honest communication is the key to ensuring a harmonious stay. Before you even book the accommodation, discuss expectations and boundaries with your travel companions. What are each person’s sleep habits?\\nAre there any specific needs or preferences to consider? Establishing clear ground rules upfront can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.\\nCompromise is also essential. With three individuals in a confined space, you’ll need to be willing to make concessions and respect each other’s needs. This could mean taking turns using the bathroom in the mornings, agreeing on a reasonable noise level at night, or dividing up storage space fairly.\\nA little give-and-take can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere. After all, the memories you create together are far more important than any minor inconveniences. 😊\\nWhen sharing a hotel room with two other people, space is at a premium. That’s why packing efficiently is crucial. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, 47% of travelers cited lack of space as one of the biggest challenges of triple occupancy accommodations. To maximize the available room, consider the following tips:\\nBy packing strategically, you can minimize clutter and ensure a more comfortable stay for everyone involved.\\nIf sharing a standard hotel room with two other people seems too cramped, consider exploring alternative accommodation options. For larger groups or those seeking more privacy, Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of vacation rentals, from apartments to entire homes.\\nThese can provide more living space, separate bedrooms, and amenities like a kitchen, making them a great choice for extended stays or families.\\nAnother option is to book adjoining or connecting hotel rooms, which can offer the convenience of a traditional hotel stay while providing additional space and privacy. Many hotels, such as Marriott and Hilton, offer discounted rates for these types of room configurations, making them a cost-effective solution for groups.\\nUltimately, the success of a triple occupancy stay comes down to open communication, compromise, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. With a little planning and flexibility, you can turn what could be a challenging situation into an opportunity for bonding and making unforgettable memories with your travel companions.\\n🎉\\nStaying in a hotel room with three people can be a practical and cost-effective solution for travelers on a budget. However, it’s crucial to understand the hotel’s policies, room configurations, and potential additional fees before booking.\\nBy considering factors such as space, comfort, and privacy, you can make an informed decision that suits your travel needs and preferences.\\nRemember, open communication, compromise, and efficient packing can go a long way in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all parties involved. If triple occupancy doesn’t seem like the right fit, explore alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels.\\nUltimately, the key is to plan ahead and make the most of your travel experience, whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or with family.\\nAre you planning a stay at a Radisson Hotel and wondering about their breakfast hours?

My wife, 21-year old daughter, and I are traveling to Rome, Florence, and Venice.  A few hotels make it obvious but many do not.  If I plug in three people on the hotels website it still only shows one bed and no mention of a roll-away, or couch that folds into a bed.  Do I assume an additional bed will be provided, or are they telling me three people are expected to sleep in one bed? \\nAny tips or insight? \\nA 3-bed room is unusual, rooms are single or double. A normal double room will not have enough spare space to add a third bed.\\nAn adult child sleeping with their parents would be regarded as unusual. Family rooms are child sized beds.\\nI suggest booking one double and one single room you would have more success.\\nWe had a triple at the Hotel Diplomatic in Rome. It consisted of two twin beds pushed together and a third, single bed, in the corner. It was pretty tight but manageable. \\nFor my upcoming July trip I found triple rooms at:\\nVenice-Hotel Ala \\nFlorence- Alba Palace\\nSiena- CAMPO REGIO RELAIS(I believe the 3rd bed here is a sleeper sofa type\\nRome-Albergo Del Senato\\nAs a recall I had to scroll down lists to find a triple room.\\nWe are traveling with our 14yo daughter.\\nHope that helps!\\nOnly way to know is either the room is labeled a triple, or to ask the hotel specifically. You can’t assume room for 3. Triples, or doubles with the option of a rollaway bed brought in, do exist but as you are finding they are somewhat rare. \\nBooking a single and a double is an option with an adult child. Or Apartment rentals are often cheaper than 2 rooms or a triple room, and have more space/privacy. It’s what I do with 2 pre-teens as 2 separate rooms is not an option and rooms for 4 are even rarer than for 3. \\nI don’t find it particularly difficult to find triple rooms. But if you need a suggestion for a Rome hotel that does have triple rooms then look at the Hotel Napoleon. They definitely do have triple rooms.\\nI\\'ve stayed in a triple room twice at Hotel Casci in Florence. Great location, nice rooms. I do understand that the family that ran Casci for years sold it a year or two ago, so you would need to check that they continue to offer triple (and at least one quad) rooms.\\nMy wife and I traveled through many countries in Europe with our teenage daughter.  We used both Booking.com and directly through hotel websites.  Now also Airbnb.  Always put in 1 room for 3 people in your searches.  Most hotels will not have what you want.  Do not assume anything.  If the results do not specifically say triple room, or three single beds, or one double bed plus one single bed do not book it.\\nWe always found nice accommodation.  Rick Steves guidebooks often list hotel’s with triple rooms and even quadruple rooms, but not every hotel has these larger rooms.  Some  hotels have 30 double rooms but only 1 or 2 triples.  \\nKeep looking and you’ll find something.  If there is a hotel you really really like just them send an email first to clarify the situation before you book.\\nIf you find a hotel you like and their website is ambiguous regarding the bed arrangements for three people, e-mail them directly and ask.\\nAs said above, triples are not as common in Italy as in the US, but they do exist. They may be have one bed for two and a bed for one, or may have three single beds. How much space is left in the room other than the beds is also quite variable; if they\\'ve made a \"triple\" by shoe-horning an extra bed into a double room, you may not have enough room to walk around.\\nIf you\\'re not able to find a suitable triple, you can get a single and a double, as said above. This also has the advantage of two bathrooms instead of one - nice anytime, and particularly handy for early departures.\\nTHANK YOU to everyone! I really appreciate all your input. \\nIf you book a room for three people, it will have three beds.  Sometimes three singles and sometimes a double and a single.  What you cannot do is book a double room and expect to find two double beds that can be used by three people.  In Europe it is more common to be charged per person rather than just being charge for a room as is common in the US.\\nIn Europe it is more common to be charged per person rather than just being charge for a room as is common in the US.\\nI believe this is a legal requirement not just an unfamiliar (to us) hotel policy issue.\\nIn Florence, room #6 at Hotel Il Bargellino is set up to meet your needs. It has one full size bed, one single bed and a good-sized ensuite bath. The room is larger than a lot of Italian hotel rooms, so not cramped for 3 people. Price is probably around 100 euro per night.\\nDon\\'t assume anything. Rooms are generally much smaller than what we might expect in the US. I can second the comment about Booking.com.

A Comprehensive Guide\\nBody: No products in the cart.\\nHome - Hotel Guide - Can 3 People Stay In A Hotel Room? A Comprehensive Guide\\nTraveling with friends or family can be an exciting adventure, but it often comes with the challenge of finding affordable accommodation. One question that frequently arises is whether it’s possible to have three people stay in a single hotel room.\\nIf you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: In most cases, three people can stay in a standard hotel room, but it’s essential to check the hotel’s policies and room configurations.\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ins and outs of having three people share a hotel room. We’ll cover topics such as hotel policies, room types, additional fees, and tips for making the most of your stay.\\nWhether you’re planning a family vacation, a friends’ getaway, or a business trip, this article will provide you with valuable insights to help you make an informed decision.\\nWhen it comes to booking a hotel room for three people, understanding the maximum occupancy limits is crucial. Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest. Many hotels allow one child under a certain age (typically 12 or 16 years old) to stay in the same room as two adults without any additional charges.\\nHowever, if the third guest is an adult or a teenager above the specified age limit, an additional fee is usually applied.\\nIt’s worth noting that some hotels may have stricter policies, only allowing two adults per room, regardless of the age of the third guest. In such cases, you may need to book a larger room or an adjoining room to accommodate your group.\\nExpedia’s Las Vegas hotel guide highlights the importance of checking age restrictions before booking, as these policies can vary significantly between hotels and destinations.\\nWhile some hotels may allow three guests in a standard room without any additional charges (as long as one is a child), it’s more common for hotels to charge extra fees for the third person. These fees can vary widely depending on the hotel, location, and season.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, the average additional fee for a third guest ranges from $10 to $50 per night.\\nIt’s essential to factor in these additional fees when budgeting for your trip, as they can quickly add up, especially for longer stays. Some hotels may offer discounts or packages for triple occupancy, so it’s always a good idea to inquire about any special deals or promotions.\\nAdditionally, checking the hotel’s website or contacting them directly can help you understand their specific policies and fees for triple occupancy.\\n\\nWhen traveling with a group of three, finding the right hotel room can be a challenge. Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind.

Price is probably around 100 euro per night.\\nDon\\'t assume anything. Rooms are generally much smaller than what we might expect in the US. I can second the comment about Booking.com. We have used it on many trips around Europe. Just go for a place rated 9.0 or better. Also note that it is a great site to start to check on hotel locations/prices with respect to tourist destinations. \\nHotel Oceania in Rome has at least one quad room.\\nWe are headed to Italy in two weeks and there are three of us (self, spouse, and 21 year old son) staying in one room.  Most of the time you have to look for a triple or family room.  We have reservations at hotel Smeraldo in Rome, so I know they have triple rooms.\\nI\\'ve booked using Hotels.com, Booking.com and Airbnb.com\\nThe hotel sites are good at letting you choose 3-person rooms.\\nAre you using one of those services?\\nhotel Smeraldo in Rome, so I know they have triple rooms.\\nand good breakfasts, and good places to eat in the vicinity, and confusing lifts (elevators - make sure you take the correct one), great bells from nearby, good shutters, good beds, tiny showers.  Very convenient.\\nWe\\'ve booked quad rooms for our upcoming trip. Adult son, 12-year old, husband and me. We found quads to be pretty common, but will confirm with the hotel just before the trip that the rooms can actually sleep 4 \"adults\". (Seems that 12-year old counts as an adult for just about everything.) Travelling as a college students years ago, triples and quads were common as well, and not just as family rooms for people with little kids. \\nHotel Foscari in Venice has a room that can handle three people in three different beds -- and the room offers a view of the canal, too.\\nThis topic has been automatically closed due to a period of inactivity.\\n©2025 Rick Steves\\' Europe, Inc. | CST# 2086743 | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy', '\\nSearch: 3\\nTitle: 3 Night Hotel Deals: Get a Cheap Hotel Three Nights | Expedia.com\\nBody: Error fetching page: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.expedia.com/lp/b/3-night-hotel-deals', \"\\nSearch: 4\\nTitle: Spa Days & Weekend Breaks for 3 people - Spabreaks.com\\nBody: \\n      Relax, unwind and escape with our selection of Groups of 3 spas.

However, here are some general insights and suggestions:\\n\\n1. **Triple Rooms**: Many hotels offer triple rooms, which typically accommodate three people. These rooms may include configurations like three single beds, one double bed plus a single bed, or two twin beds with a rollaway bed. However, these rooms often have only one bathroom.\\n\\n2. **Adjoining or Connecting Rooms**: If you require more space and additional bathrooms, booking two adjoining or connecting rooms might be a better option. This setup can provide privacy and convenience, especially for groups.\\n\\n3. **Suites or Family Rooms**: Some hotels offer suites or family rooms that may include multiple bedrooms and bathrooms. These are ideal for groups seeking more space and amenities.\\n\\n4. **Alternative Accommodations**: Vacation rentals or apartments through platforms like Airbnb or VRBO often provide multiple rooms and bathrooms, making them a suitable option for groups of three or more.\\n\\n5. **Specific Hotel Recommendations**: While no specific hotels with 3 rooms and 2 bathrooms were mentioned, some hotels known for accommodating groups include:\\n   - Hotel Napoleon in Rome (offers triple rooms).\\n   - Hotel Casci in Florence (offers triple and quad rooms).\\n   - Hotel Smeraldo in Rome (offers triple rooms).\\n   - Hotel Foscari in Venice (offers rooms for three people with separate beds).\\n\\n### Recommendation:\\nTo find accommodations that meet your specific requirements (3 rooms, 2 bathrooms, 3 people, 3 nights), it is best to:\\n- Use hotel booking platforms like Booking.com or Hotels.com and filter for your needs.\\n- Contact hotels directly to confirm room configurations and bathroom availability.\\n- Consider vacation rentals for more flexibility in room and bathroom arrangements.']\n",

A professional journalist, he joined the comp...\\n    \\nHere at Thrifty Traveler, we're all about cheap flights. But traveling on the cheap goes beyond airfare: Hotel costs can add up even faster. Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons. For one, they can be a saving grace when hotel rates are too high. Often, you can find better value booking an entire apartment than you can booking a tiny hotel room.\\xa0Plus, if you're traveling with a group, Airbnbs can help you stay together in a place with a shared kitchen and living spaces.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf something like that is more your speed, then use both Vrbo and Airbnb to start your search. Both websites operate similarly and can be searched with a long list of filters and using the map.\\nVacation rental websites like these are a great way to find a special, unique stay as well. Want something with a little bit of charm instead of a sterile hotel room? Live in someone's home!\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFinding the best hotel booking site and the sweetest hotel deals doesn't have to be stressful.

Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services.

Our opinions are our own.\\nHow is this page expert verified?\\nNerdWallet's content is fact-checked for accuracy, timeliness and relevance. It undergoes a thorough review process involving writers and editors to ensure the information is as clear and complete as possible.\\nCarissa Rawson\\nMeg Lee\\nThe internet is full of high-end aspirational hotel redemptions. From an overwater villa in the Maldives to a chic Parisian loft, these drool-worthy properties almost always have one thing in common: no room for families.\\nSo what do you when a journey includes mom, dad, the kids and a friend or two? Find a hotel that allows you to book two-bedroom suites with points. It’s especially easy in the U.S., where such properties can be more common than overseas.\\nWhat hotels have two-bedroom suites that you can book with points? Stick with the following brands.\\n» Learn more: A beginners guide to points and miles\\nIt can be difficult to figure out which hotel chains offer suites, let alone allow you to book them with points. This is heavily dependent not just on the chain, but also on the brand, as different brands offer different amenities. The JW Marriott, for example, is known for high-end luxury rooms, and suites will be marketed and priced accordingly. Other brands, such as Residence Inn by Marriott, provide accommodations to long-term travelers, which means suites will be much easier to find.\\nThe good news is that most popular chains will have at least one hotel with multiple-room suites. The bad news is that a lot of the time they’ll cost more — and sometimes significantly more — than a regular room. But there are some gems to be found if you’re willing to look.\\nHilton doesn’t operate a fixed award chart — instead, the cost of reward nights fluctuates according to demand. It offers standard room redemptions and premium room rewards. You likely won’t find any Hilton hotels with multiple room suites that offer a standard room redemption, but sometimes the prices you find won’t be overly exorbitant.\\nHilton’s extended stay options, such as Homewood Suites and Home2 Suites, are both more likely to offer hotels with two-bedroom suites.\\n\\nHilton’s timeshare brand, Hilton Grand Vacations, is a resort-like option that spans the globe. These properties have single rooms, but also focus on larger spaces to accommodate families.\\n\\nAgain, you’ll need to pay the premium room reward rate, but with units up to three bedrooms in size, you can squeeze in several people.\\n» Learn more: Which hotel elite status should you pursue in 2021?\\nHyatt doesn’t have any brands that reliably offer hotels with two room suites, but it is possible to find some properties that feature larger spaces.\\nWith Hyatt, look for extended-stay properties; in this case, Hyatt House will be the best option for a reservation. Hyatt operates on a fixed price award chart for redemptions, and a suite will likely be considered a “standard suite free night.”\\n\\nThese properties aren’t available everywhere — you’ll have to search Hyatt’s site to find the hotels you could book in your destination.\\nMarriott has a robust timeshare system that offers condo-like resort hotels, similar to Hilton, that you can book with points. The list of Marriott Vacation Club hotels is extensive and features properties all over the world, many of which include expansive grounds that feature hotels with two-room suites.\\n\\nHotels like the Phoenician Residences, a Luxury Collection Residence Club, Scottsdale and Marriott’s Grande Vista can be booked with Marriott Bonvoy points.\\nYou can also try checking out Residence Inn properties, which have two-bedroom suites, though a lot of the time these are not available to book with points — only cash.\\n» Learn more: The points collector's guide to Marriott Bonvoy\\nChoice Hotels is less famous than its peers in the points and miles community, but there is a lot to love about this rewards program. Unlike other chains, Choice charges a single rewards rate, regardless if you’re booking the cheapest or most expensive room.\\n\\nNot all rooms are available to book with points, but there’s a decent selection for midrange hotels, especially with the Comfort Suites brand.\\nWyndham is another undervalued program. While it may not have some of the ultra-enviable properties that Hyatt, Hilton and Marriott do, it charges reasonable rates, which vary from 7,500 to 30,000 points per bedroom each night.\\n\\nPossible award stays can be found at hotels like Utah's Park Plaza Resort Park City a Ramada by Wyndham and the Club Wyndham Park City.\\n» Learn more: The best hotel credit cards right now\\nIt can be difficult to find hotels to book with points, especially if you’re traveling in a large group and need two-bedroom suites. While it’s not always a guarantee, Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Choice and Wyndham hotels all offer varying ways of booking larger-size rooms.\\nWith a little flexibility and the right points, you and your travel group can stay together in one of these expansive rooms.\\nYou want a travel credit card that prioritizes what’s important to you. Here are some of the best travel credit cards of 2025:\\nFlexibility, point transfers and a large bonus: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card\\nNo annual fee: Wells Fargo Autograph® Card  \\nFlat-rate travel rewards: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card \\nBonus travel rewards and high-end perks: Chase Sapphire Reserve® \\nLuxury perks: The Platinum Card® from American Express \\nBusiness travelers: Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card \\nChase Sapphire Preferred® Card\\nTravel\\nHotel\\nWHY OUR NERDS LOVE IT:  For a modest fee, you’ll earn rich rewards in many categories, plus access to multiple transfer partners, an annual hotel credit, anniversary points and a big sign-up bonus.\\nDownload the app\\n Disclaimer: \\nNerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.\\n            This information may be different than what you see when you visit a\\n            financial institution, service provider or specific product's\\n            site.

From an overwater villa in the Maldives to a chic Parisian loft, these drool-worthy properties almost always have one thing in common: no room for families.\\nSo what do you when a journey includes mom, dad, the kids and a friend or two? Find a hotel that allows you to book two-bedroom suites with points. It’s especially easy in the U.S., where such properties can be more common than overseas.\\nWhat hotels have two-bedroom suites that you can book with points? Stick with the following brands.\\n» Learn more: A beginners guide to points and miles\\nIt can be difficult to figure out which hotel chains offer suites, let alone allow you to book them with points. This is heavily dependent not just on the chain, but also on the brand, as different brands offer different amenities. The JW Marriott, for example, is known for high-end luxury rooms, and suites will be marketed and priced accordingly. Other brands, such as Residence Inn by Marriott, provide accommodations to long-term travelers, which means suites will be much easier to find.\\nThe good news is that most popular chains will have at least one hotel with multiple-room suites. The bad news is that a lot of the time they’ll cost more — and sometimes significantly more — than a regular room. But there are some gems to be found if you’re willing to look.\\nHilton doesn’t operate a fixed award chart — instead, the cost of reward nights fluctuates according to demand. It offers standard room redemptions and premium room rewards. You likely won’t find any Hilton hotels with multiple room suites that offer a standard room redemption, but sometimes the prices you find won’t be overly exorbitant.\\nHilton’s extended stay options, such as Homewood Suites and Home2 Suites, are both more likely to offer hotels with two-bedroom suites.\\n\\nHilton’s timeshare brand, Hilton Grand Vacations, is a resort-like option that spans the globe. These properties have single rooms, but also focus on larger spaces to accommodate families.\\n\\nAgain, you’ll need to pay the premium room reward rate, but with units up to three bedrooms in size, you can squeeze in several people.\\n» Learn more: Which hotel elite status should you pursue in 2021?\\nHyatt doesn’t have any brands that reliably offer hotels with two room suites, but it is possible to find some properties that feature larger spaces.\\nWith Hyatt, look for extended-stay properties; in this case, Hyatt House will be the best option for a reservation. Hyatt operates on a fixed price award chart for redemptions, and a suite will likely be considered a “standard suite free night.”\\n\\nThese properties aren’t available everywhere — you’ll have to search Hyatt’s site to find the hotels you could book in your destination.\\nMarriott has a robust timeshare system that offers condo-like resort hotels, similar to Hilton, that you can book with points. The list of Marriott Vacation Club hotels is extensive and features properties all over the world, many of which include expansive grounds that feature hotels with two-room suites.\\n\\nHotels like the Phoenician Residences, a Luxury Collection Residence Club, Scottsdale and Marriott’s Grande Vista can be booked with Marriott Bonvoy points.\\nYou can also try checking out Residence Inn properties, which have two-bedroom suites, though a lot of the time these are not available to book with points — only cash.\\n» Learn more: The points collector's guide to Marriott Bonvoy\\nChoice Hotels is less famous than its peers in the points and miles community, but there is a lot to love about this rewards program. Unlike other chains, Choice charges a single rewards rate, regardless if you’re booking the cheapest or most expensive room.\\n\\nNot all rooms are available to book with points, but there’s a decent selection for midrange hotels, especially with the Comfort Suites brand.\\nWyndham is another undervalued program. While it may not have some of the ultra-enviable properties that Hyatt, Hilton and Marriott do, it charges reasonable rates, which vary from 7,500 to 30,000 points per bedroom each night.\\n\\nPossible award stays can be found at hotels like Utah's Park Plaza Resort Park City a Ramada by Wyndham and the Club Wyndham Park City.\\n» Learn more: The best hotel credit cards right now\\nIt can be difficult to find hotels to book with points, especially if you’re traveling in a large group and need two-bedroom suites. While it’s not always a guarantee, Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Choice and Wyndham hotels all offer varying ways of booking larger-size rooms.\\nWith a little flexibility and the right points, you and your travel group can stay together in one of these expansive rooms.\\nYou want a travel credit card that prioritizes what’s important to you. Here are some of the best travel credit cards of 2025:\\nFlexibility, point transfers and a large bonus: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card\\nNo annual fee: Wells Fargo Autograph® Card  \\nFlat-rate travel rewards: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card \\nBonus travel rewards and high-end perks: Chase Sapphire Reserve® \\nLuxury perks: The Platinum Card® from American Express \\nBusiness travelers: Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card \\nChase Sapphire Preferred® Card\\nTravel\\nHotel\\nWHY OUR NERDS LOVE IT:  For a modest fee, you’ll earn rich rewards in many categories, plus access to multiple transfer partners, an annual hotel credit, anniversary points and a big sign-up bonus.\\nDownload the app\\n Disclaimer: \\nNerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.\\n            This information may be different than what you see when you visit a\\n            financial institution, service provider or specific product's\\n            site.

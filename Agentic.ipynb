A Comprehensive Guide\\nBody: No products in the cart.\\nHome - Hotel Guide - Can 3 People Stay In A Hotel Room? A Comprehensive Guide\\nTraveling with friends or family can be an exciting adventure, but it often comes with the challenge of finding affordable accommodation. One question that frequently arises is whether it’s possible to have three people stay in a single hotel room.\\nIf you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: In most cases, three people can stay in a standard hotel room, but it’s essential to check the hotel’s policies and room configurations.\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ins and outs of having three people share a hotel room. We’ll cover topics such as hotel policies, room types, additional fees, and tips for making the most of your stay.\\nWhether you’re planning a family vacation, a friends’ getaway, or a business trip, this article will provide you with valuable insights to help you make an informed decision.\\nWhen it comes to booking a hotel room for three people, understanding the maximum occupancy limits is crucial. Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest. Many hotels allow one child under a certain age (typically 12 or 16 years old) to stay in the same room as two adults without any additional charges.\\nHowever, if the third guest is an adult or a teenager above the specified age limit, an additional fee is usually applied.\\nIt’s worth noting that some hotels may have stricter policies, only allowing two adults per room, regardless of the age of the third guest. In such cases, you may need to book a larger room or an adjoining room to accommodate your group.\\nExpedia’s Las Vegas hotel guide highlights the importance of checking age restrictions before booking, as these policies can vary significantly between hotels and destinations.\\nWhile some hotels may allow three guests in a standard room without any additional charges (as long as one is a child), it’s more common for hotels to charge extra fees for the third person. These fees can vary widely depending on the hotel, location, and season.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, the average additional fee for a third guest ranges from $10 to $50 per night.\\nIt’s essential to factor in these additional fees when budgeting for your trip, as they can quickly add up, especially for longer stays. Some hotels may offer discounts or packages for triple occupancy, so it’s always a good idea to inquire about any special deals or promotions.\\nAdditionally, checking the hotel’s website or contacting them directly can help you understand their specific policies and fees for triple occupancy.\\n\\nWhen traveling with a group of three, finding the right hotel room can be a challenge. Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind. Most standard hotel rooms are designed for double occupancy, with two beds or a king-size bed. Accommodating a third person can make the room feel cramped and crowded, potentially compromising your overall comfort during your stay.\\nTo ensure a pleasant experience, it’s essential to evaluate the room size and layout. Some hotels offer larger rooms or suites specifically designed for triple occupancy, with additional sleeping arrangements like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, 68% of travelers prioritize room size and amenities when booking a hotel room for three or more guests. 😊\\nAdditionally, consider the purpose of your stay. If you’re traveling for leisure and plan to spend significant time in the room, having ample space to move around and relax comfortably is crucial. However, if you’re on a business trip and primarily need the room for sleeping, a more compact space might be tolerable.\\nSharing a hotel room with three people can raise privacy concerns, especially if you’re not traveling with close friends or family. Lack of personal space and the need to coordinate schedules for using shared facilities like the bathroom can be challenging.\\nIt’s essential to have open communication and establish ground rules with your roommates to respect each other’s privacy and create a harmonious environment.\\nSome hotels offer connecting rooms or suites with separate living areas, which can provide a degree of privacy while still allowing for shared spaces. However, these options often come at a higher cost.\\nIf privacy is a top priority, it might be worth considering booking separate rooms or alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or apartments.\\nWhen booking a hotel room for three people, it’s crucial to consider the amenities and facilities offered. Look for rooms with sufficient towels, toiletries, and other essentials to accommodate all guests.\\n👍 Some hotels may charge additional fees for extra amenities or roll-away beds, so be sure to inquire about these charges in advance.\\nIf you plan to spend time in the room together, check if the hotel offers amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, or coffee maker, which can enhance your overall comfort and convenience. Additionally, consider the availability of on-site restaurants, fitness centers, or recreational facilities that can accommodate your group’s needs.\\nIt’s also worth noting that some hotels have policies or restrictions on triple occupancy, so be sure to check their guidelines before booking. For example, some hotels may not allow more than two adults per room or may charge additional fees for a third person.\\nWhen three people share a hotel room, open and honest communication is the key to ensuring a harmonious stay. Before you even book the accommodation, discuss expectations and boundaries with your travel companions. What are each person’s sleep habits?\\nAre there any specific needs or preferences to consider? Establishing clear ground rules upfront can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.\\nCompromise is also essential. With three individuals in a confined space, you’ll need to be willing to make concessions and respect each other’s needs. This could mean taking turns using the bathroom in the mornings, agreeing on a reasonable noise level at night, or dividing up storage space fairly.\\nA little give-and-take can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere. After all, the memories you create together are far more important than any minor inconveniences. 😊\\nWhen sharing a hotel room with two other people, space is at a premium. That’s why packing efficiently is crucial. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, 47% of travelers cited lack of space as one of the biggest challenges of triple occupancy accommodations. To maximize the available room, consider the following tips:\\nBy packing strategically, you can minimize clutter and ensure a more comfortable stay for everyone involved.\\nIf sharing a standard hotel room with two other people seems too cramped, consider exploring alternative accommodation options. For larger groups or those seeking more privacy, Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of vacation rentals, from apartments to entire homes.\\nThese can provide more living space, separate bedrooms, and amenities like a kitchen, making them a great choice for extended stays or families.\\nAnother option is to book adjoining or connecting hotel rooms, which can offer the convenience of a traditional hotel stay while providing additional space and privacy. Many hotels, such as Marriott and Hilton, offer discounted rates for these types of room configurations, making them a cost-effective solution for groups.\\nUltimately, the success of a triple occupancy stay comes down to open communication, compromise, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. With a little planning and flexibility, you can turn what could be a challenging situation into an opportunity for bonding and making unforgettable memories with your travel companions.\\n🎉\\nStaying in a hotel room with three people can be a practical and cost-effective solution for travelers on a budget. However, it’s crucial to understand the hotel’s policies, room configurations, and potential additional fees before booking.\\nBy considering factors such as space, comfort, and privacy, you can make an informed decision that suits your travel needs and preferences.\\nRemember, open communication, compromise, and efficient packing can go a long way in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all parties involved. If triple occupancy doesn’t seem like the right fit, explore alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels.\\nUltimately, the key is to plan ahead and make the most of your travel experience, whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or with family.\\nAre you planning a stay at a Radisson Hotel and wondering about their breakfast hours?

My wife, 21-year old daughter, and I are traveling to Rome, Florence, and Venice.  A few hotels make it obvious but many do not.  If I plug in three people on the hotels website it still only shows one bed and no mention of a roll-away, or couch that folds into a bed.  Do I assume an additional bed will be provided, or are they telling me three people are expected to sleep in one bed? \\nAny tips or insight? \\nA 3-bed room is unusual, rooms are single or double. A normal double room will not have enough spare space to add a third bed.\\nAn adult child sleeping with their parents would be regarded as unusual. Family rooms are child sized beds.\\nI suggest booking one double and one single room you would have more success.\\nWe had a triple at the Hotel Diplomatic in Rome. It consisted of two twin beds pushed together and a third, single bed, in the corner. It was pretty tight but manageable. \\nFor my upcoming July trip I found triple rooms at:\\nVenice-Hotel Ala \\nFlorence- Alba Palace\\nSiena- CAMPO REGIO RELAIS(I believe the 3rd bed here is a sleeper sofa type\\nRome-Albergo Del Senato\\nAs a recall I had to scroll down lists to find a triple room.\\nWe are traveling with our 14yo daughter.\\nHope that helps!\\nOnly way to know is either the room is labeled a triple, or to ask the hotel specifically. You can’t assume room for 3. Triples, or doubles with the option of a rollaway bed brought in, do exist but as you are finding they are somewhat rare. \\nBooking a single and a double is an option with an adult child. Or Apartment rentals are often cheaper than 2 rooms or a triple room, and have more space/privacy. It’s what I do with 2 pre-teens as 2 separate rooms is not an option and rooms for 4 are even rarer than for 3. \\nI don’t find it particularly difficult to find triple rooms. But if you need a suggestion for a Rome hotel that does have triple rooms then look at the Hotel Napoleon. They definitely do have triple rooms.\\nI\\'ve stayed in a triple room twice at Hotel Casci in Florence. Great location, nice rooms. I do understand that the family that ran Casci for years sold it a year or two ago, so you would need to check that they continue to offer triple (and at least one quad) rooms.\\nMy wife and I traveled through many countries in Europe with our teenage daughter.  We used both Booking.com and directly through hotel websites.  Now also Airbnb.  Always put in 1 room for 3 people in your searches.  Most hotels will not have what you want.  Do not assume anything.  If the results do not specifically say triple room, or three single beds, or one double bed plus one single bed do not book it.\\nWe always found nice accommodation.  Rick Steves guidebooks often list hotel’s with triple rooms and even quadruple rooms, but not every hotel has these larger rooms.  Some  hotels have 30 double rooms but only 1 or 2 triples.  \\nKeep looking and you’ll find something.  If there is a hotel you really really like just them send an email first to clarify the situation before you book.\\nIf you find a hotel you like and their website is ambiguous regarding the bed arrangements for three people, e-mail them directly and ask.\\nAs said above, triples are not as common in Italy as in the US, but they do exist. They may be have one bed for two and a bed for one, or may have three single beds. How much space is left in the room other than the beds is also quite variable; if they\\'ve made a \"triple\" by shoe-horning an extra bed into a double room, you may not have enough room to walk around.\\nIf you\\'re not able to find a suitable triple, you can get a single and a double, as said above. This also has the advantage of two bathrooms instead of one - nice anytime, and particularly handy for early departures.\\nTHANK YOU to everyone! I really appreciate all your input. \\nIf you book a room for three people, it will have three beds.  Sometimes three singles and sometimes a double and a single.  What you cannot do is book a double room and expect to find two double beds that can be used by three people.  In Europe it is more common to be charged per person rather than just being charge for a room as is common in the US.\\nIn Europe it is more common to be charged per person rather than just being charge for a room as is common in the US.\\nI believe this is a legal requirement not just an unfamiliar (to us) hotel policy issue.\\nIn Florence, room #6 at Hotel Il Bargellino is set up to meet your needs. It has one full size bed, one single bed and a good-sized ensuite bath. The room is larger than a lot of Italian hotel rooms, so not cramped for 3 people. Price is probably around 100 euro per night.\\nDon\\'t assume anything. Rooms are generally much smaller than what we might expect in the US. I can second the comment about Booking.com. We have used it on many trips around Europe. Just go for a place rated 9.0 or better.

Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest.

Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind. Most standard hotel rooms are designed for double occupancy, with two beds or a king-size bed. Accommodating a third person can make the room feel cramped and crowded, potentially compromising your overall comfort during your stay.\\nTo ensure a pleasant experience, it’s essential to evaluate the room size and layout. Some hotels offer larger rooms or suites specifically designed for triple occupancy, with additional sleeping arrangements like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, 68% of travelers prioritize room size and amenities when booking a hotel room for three or more guests. 😊\\nAdditionally, consider the purpose of your stay. If you’re traveling for leisure and plan to spend significant time in the room, having ample space to move around and relax comfortably is crucial. However, if you’re on a business trip and primarily need the room for sleeping, a more compact space might be tolerable.\\nSharing a hotel room with three people can raise privacy concerns, especially if you’re not traveling with close friends or family. Lack of personal space and the need to coordinate schedules for using shared facilities like the bathroom can be challenging.\\nIt’s essential to have open communication and establish ground rules with your roommates to respect each other’s privacy and create a harmonious environment.\\nSome hotels offer connecting rooms or suites with separate living areas, which can provide a degree of privacy while still allowing for shared spaces. However, these options often come at a higher cost.\\nIf privacy is a top priority, it might be worth considering booking separate rooms or alternative accommodations, such as vacation rentals or apartments.\\nWhen booking a hotel room for three people, it’s crucial to consider the amenities and facilities offered. Look for rooms with sufficient towels, toiletries, and other essentials to accommodate all guests.\\n👍 Some hotels may charge additional fees for extra amenities or roll-away beds, so be sure to inquire about these charges in advance.\\nIf you plan to spend time in the room together, check if the hotel offers amenities like a mini-fridge, microwave, or coffee maker, which can enhance your overall comfort and convenience. Additionally, consider the availability of on-site restaurants, fitness centers, or recreational facilities that can accommodate your group’s needs.\\nIt’s also worth noting that some hotels have policies or restrictions on triple occupancy, so be sure to check their guidelines before booking. For example, some hotels may not allow more than two adults per room or may charge additional fees for a third person.\\nWhen three people share a hotel room, open and honest communication is the key to ensuring a harmonious stay. Before you even book the accommodation, discuss expectations and boundaries with your travel companions. What are each person’s sleep habits?\\nAre there any specific needs or preferences to consider? Establishing clear ground rules upfront can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.\\nCompromise is also essential. With three individuals in a confined space, you’ll need to be willing to make concessions and respect each other’s needs. This could mean taking turns using the bathroom in the mornings, agreeing on a reasonable noise level at night, or dividing up storage space fairly.\\nA little give-and-take can go a long way in maintaining a positive atmosphere. After all, the memories you create together are far more important than any minor inconveniences. 😊\\nWhen sharing a hotel room with two other people, space is at a premium. That’s why packing efficiently is crucial. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, 47% of travelers cited lack of space as one of the biggest challenges of triple occupancy accommodations. To maximize the available room, consider the following tips:\\nBy packing strategically, you can minimize clutter and ensure a more comfortable stay for everyone involved.\\nIf sharing a standard hotel room with two other people seems too cramped, consider exploring alternative accommodation options. For larger groups or those seeking more privacy, Airbnb and VRBO offer a wide range of vacation rentals, from apartments to entire homes.\\nThese can provide more living space, separate bedrooms, and amenities like a kitchen, making them a great choice for extended stays or families.\\nAnother option is to book adjoining or connecting hotel rooms, which can offer the convenience of a traditional hotel stay while providing additional space and privacy. Many hotels, such as Marriott and Hilton, offer discounted rates for these types of room configurations, making them a cost-effective solution for groups.\\nUltimately, the success of a triple occupancy stay comes down to open communication, compromise, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. With a little planning and flexibility, you can turn what could be a challenging situation into an opportunity for bonding and making unforgettable memories with your travel companions.\\n🎉\\nStaying in a hotel room with three people can be a practical and cost-effective solution for travelers on a budget. However, it’s crucial to understand the hotel’s policies, room configurations, and potential additional fees before booking.\\nBy considering factors such as space, comfort, and privacy, you can make an informed decision that suits your travel needs and preferences.\\nRemember, open communication, compromise, and efficient packing can go a long way in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all parties involved. If triple occupancy doesn’t seem like the right fit, explore alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels.\\nUltimately, the key is to plan ahead and make the most of your travel experience, whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or with family.\\nAre you planning a stay at a Radisson Hotel and wondering about their breakfast hours?

My wife, 21-year old daughter, and I are traveling to Rome, Florence, and Venice.  A few hotels make it obvious but many do not.  If I plug in three people on the hotels website it still only shows one bed and no mention of a roll-away, or couch that folds into a bed.  Do I assume an additional bed will be provided, or are they telling me three people are expected to sleep in one bed? \\nAny tips or insight? \\nA 3-bed room is unusual, rooms are single or double. A normal double room will not have enough spare space to add a third bed.\\nAn adult child sleeping with their parents would be regarded as unusual. Family rooms are child sized beds.\\nI suggest booking one double and one single room you would have more success.\\nWe had a triple at the Hotel Diplomatic in Rome. It consisted of two twin beds pushed together and a third, single bed, in the corner. It was pretty tight but manageable. \\nFor my upcoming July trip I found triple rooms at:\\nVenice-Hotel Ala \\nFlorence- Alba Palace\\nSiena- CAMPO REGIO RELAIS(I believe the 3rd bed here is a sleeper sofa type\\nRome-Albergo Del Senato\\nAs a recall I had to scroll down lists to find a triple room.\\nWe are traveling with our 14yo daughter.\\nHope that helps!\\nOnly way to know is either the room is labeled a triple, or to ask the hotel specifically. You can’t assume room for 3. Triples, or doubles with the option of a rollaway bed brought in, do exist but as you are finding they are somewhat rare. \\nBooking a single and a double is an option with an adult child. Or Apartment rentals are often cheaper than 2 rooms or a triple room, and have more space/privacy. It’s what I do with 2 pre-teens as 2 separate rooms is not an option and rooms for 4 are even rarer than for 3. \\nI don’t find it particularly difficult to find triple rooms. But if you need a suggestion for a Rome hotel that does have triple rooms then look at the Hotel Napoleon. They definitely do have triple rooms.\\nI\\'ve stayed in a triple room twice at Hotel Casci in Florence. Great location, nice rooms. I do understand that the family that ran Casci for years sold it a year or two ago, so you would need to check that they continue to offer triple (and at least one quad) rooms.\\nMy wife and I traveled through many countries in Europe with our teenage daughter.  We used both Booking.com and directly through hotel websites.  Now also Airbnb.  Always put in 1 room for 3 people in your searches.  Most hotels will not have what you want.  Do not assume anything.  If the results do not specifically say triple room, or three single beds, or one double bed plus one single bed do not book it.\\nWe always found nice accommodation.  Rick Steves guidebooks often list hotel’s with triple rooms and even quadruple rooms, but not every hotel has these larger rooms.  Some  hotels have 30 double rooms but only 1 or 2 triples.  \\nKeep looking and you’ll find something.  If there is a hotel you really really like just them send an email first to clarify the situation before you book.\\nIf you find a hotel you like and their website is ambiguous regarding the bed arrangements for three people, e-mail them directly and ask.\\nAs said above, triples are not as common in Italy as in the US, but they do exist. They may be have one bed for two and a bed for one, or may have three single beds. How much space is left in the room other than the beds is also quite variable; if they\\'ve made a \"triple\" by shoe-horning an extra bed into a double room, you may not have enough room to walk around.\\nIf you\\'re not able to find a suitable triple, you can get a single and a double, as said above. This also has the advantage of two bathrooms instead of one - nice anytime, and particularly handy for early departures.\\nTHANK YOU to everyone! I really appreciate all your input. \\nIf you book a room for three people, it will have three beds.  Sometimes three singles and sometimes a double and a single.  What you cannot do is book a double room and expect to find two double beds that can be used by three people.  In Europe it is more common to be charged per person rather than just being charge for a room as is common in the US.\\nIn Europe it is more common to be charged per person rather than just being charge for a room as is common in the US.\\nI believe this is a legal requirement not just an unfamiliar (to us) hotel policy issue.\\nIn Florence, room #6 at Hotel Il Bargellino is set up to meet your needs. It has one full size bed, one single bed and a good-sized ensuite bath. The room is larger than a lot of Italian hotel rooms, so not cramped for 3 people. Price is probably around 100 euro per night.\\nDon\\'t assume anything. Rooms are generally much smaller than what we might expect in the US. I can second the comment about Booking.com.

A Comprehensive Guide\\nBody: No products in the cart.\\nHome - Hotel Guide - Can 3 People Stay In A Hotel Room? A Comprehensive Guide\\nTraveling with friends or family can be an exciting adventure, but it often comes with the challenge of finding affordable accommodation. One question that frequently arises is whether it’s possible to have three people stay in a single hotel room.\\nIf you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer to your question: In most cases, three people can stay in a standard hotel room, but it’s essential to check the hotel’s policies and room configurations.\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ins and outs of having three people share a hotel room. We’ll cover topics such as hotel policies, room types, additional fees, and tips for making the most of your stay.\\nWhether you’re planning a family vacation, a friends’ getaway, or a business trip, this article will provide you with valuable insights to help you make an informed decision.\\nWhen it comes to booking a hotel room for three people, understanding the maximum occupancy limits is crucial. Most hotels have strict policies in place regarding the number of guests allowed per room.\\nThe standard occupancy limit for a standard room is typically two adults, but many hotels allow a third person (often a child) to stay for an additional fee. This limit is set for safety reasons and to ensure a comfortable stay for all guests.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that some hotels may have more flexible policies, allowing up to four or even five guests in certain room types, such as suites or family rooms. Hotels.com suggests checking with the hotel directly to inquire about their specific occupancy limits and any additional charges that may apply for extra guests.\\nWhen it comes to age restrictions for triple occupancy, hotels often have different rules depending on the age of the third guest. Many hotels allow one child under a certain age (typically 12 or 16 years old) to stay in the same room as two adults without any additional charges.\\nHowever, if the third guest is an adult or a teenager above the specified age limit, an additional fee is usually applied.\\nIt’s worth noting that some hotels may have stricter policies, only allowing two adults per room, regardless of the age of the third guest. In such cases, you may need to book a larger room or an adjoining room to accommodate your group.\\nExpedia’s Las Vegas hotel guide highlights the importance of checking age restrictions before booking, as these policies can vary significantly between hotels and destinations.\\nWhile some hotels may allow three guests in a standard room without any additional charges (as long as one is a child), it’s more common for hotels to charge extra fees for the third person. These fees can vary widely depending on the hotel, location, and season.\\nAccording to a survey by TripAdvisor, the average additional fee for a third guest ranges from $10 to $50 per night.\\nIt’s essential to factor in these additional fees when budgeting for your trip, as they can quickly add up, especially for longer stays. Some hotels may offer discounts or packages for triple occupancy, so it’s always a good idea to inquire about any special deals or promotions.\\nAdditionally, checking the hotel’s website or contacting them directly can help you understand their specific policies and fees for triple occupancy.\\n\\nWhen traveling with a group of three, finding the right hotel room can be a challenge. Fortunately, many hotels now offer a variety of room types designed to accommodate triple occupancy comfortably. Here are some of the most common options:\\nThe most common and affordable option for three people is a standard room with two beds. These rooms typically feature two queen or double beds, providing enough sleeping space for three adults or two adults and one child.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that these rooms may feel cramped, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room. According to a survey by TripAdvisor, approximately 65% of travelers prefer rooms with two beds for triple occupancy.\\nFor those seeking more space and privacy, suites and family rooms are excellent choices. These larger accommodations often feature a separate living area, allowing guests to spread out and enjoy additional amenities like a sofa bed or rollaway bed.\\nSome hotels even offer family suites with bunk beds or separate bedrooms, making them ideal for families or groups with children. According to a report by Hotel News Resource, the demand for family suites has increased by 28% in the past five years, reflecting the growing trend of multi-generational travel.\\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective option or the hotel doesn’t offer dedicated triple occupancy rooms, many establishments provide rollaway beds or cots for an additional fee. These temporary sleeping arrangements can be added to a standard room, allowing three guests to share the space.\\nHowever, it’s essential to inquire about the availability and costs of rollaway beds or cots in advance, as they may be limited or subject to additional charges. According to a study by Hotels.com, approximately 42% of hotels charge an extra fee for rollaway beds, with the average cost ranging from $10 to $30 per night.\\nRegardless of your choice, it’s always a good idea to communicate your needs clearly with the hotel during the booking process. Many hotels have specific policies and restrictions regarding triple occupancy, so it’s crucial to understand their guidelines before making a reservation.\\nBy considering factors like budget, space requirements, and amenities, you can find the perfect room type that ensures a comfortable and enjoyable stay for all three guests. 😊\\nWhen considering triple occupancy in a hotel room, space and comfort are crucial factors to keep in mind.

Price is probably around 100 euro per night.\\nDon\\'t assume anything. Rooms are generally much smaller than what we might expect in the US. I can second the comment about Booking.com. We have used it on many trips around Europe. Just go for a place rated 9.0 or better. Also note that it is a great site to start to check on hotel locations/prices with respect to tourist destinations. \\nHotel Oceania in Rome has at least one quad room.\\nWe are headed to Italy in two weeks and there are three of us (self, spouse, and 21 year old son) staying in one room.  Most of the time you have to look for a triple or family room.  We have reservations at hotel Smeraldo in Rome, so I know they have triple rooms.\\nI\\'ve booked using Hotels.com, Booking.com and Airbnb.com\\nThe hotel sites are good at letting you choose 3-person rooms.\\nAre you using one of those services?\\nhotel Smeraldo in Rome, so I know they have triple rooms.\\nand good breakfasts, and good places to eat in the vicinity, and confusing lifts (elevators - make sure you take the correct one), great bells from nearby, good shutters, good beds, tiny showers.  Very convenient.\\nWe\\'ve booked quad rooms for our upcoming trip. Adult son, 12-year old, husband and me. We found quads to be pretty common, but will confirm with the hotel just before the trip that the rooms can actually sleep 4 \"adults\". (Seems that 12-year old counts as an adult for just about everything.) Travelling as a college students years ago, triples and quads were common as well, and not just as family rooms for people with little kids. \\nHotel Foscari in Venice has a room that can handle three people in three different beds -- and the room offers a view of the canal, too.\\nThis topic has been automatically closed due to a period of inactivity.\\n©2025 Rick Steves\\' Europe, Inc. | CST# 2086743 | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy', '\\nSearch: 3\\nTitle: 3 Night Hotel Deals: Get a Cheap Hotel Three Nights | Expedia.com\\nBody: Error fetching page: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.expedia.com/lp/b/3-night-hotel-deals', \"\\nSearch: 4\\nTitle: Spa Days & Weekend Breaks for 3 people - Spabreaks.com\\nBody: \\n      Relax, unwind and escape with our selection of Groups of 3 spas.

However, here are some general insights and suggestions:\\n\\n1. **Triple Rooms**: Many hotels offer triple rooms, which typically accommodate three people. These rooms may include configurations like three single beds, one double bed plus a single bed, or two twin beds with a rollaway bed. However, these rooms often have only one bathroom.\\n\\n2. **Adjoining or Connecting Rooms**: If you require more space and additional bathrooms, booking two adjoining or connecting rooms might be a better option. This setup can provide privacy and convenience, especially for groups.\\n\\n3. **Suites or Family Rooms**: Some hotels offer suites or family rooms that may include multiple bedrooms and bathrooms. These are ideal for groups seeking more space and amenities.\\n\\n4. **Alternative Accommodations**: Vacation rentals or apartments through platforms like Airbnb or VRBO often provide multiple rooms and bathrooms, making them a suitable option for groups of three or more.\\n\\n5. **Specific Hotel Recommendations**: While no specific hotels with 3 rooms and 2 bathrooms were mentioned, some hotels known for accommodating groups include:\\n   - Hotel Napoleon in Rome (offers triple rooms).\\n   - Hotel Casci in Florence (offers triple and quad rooms).\\n   - Hotel Smeraldo in Rome (offers triple rooms).\\n   - Hotel Foscari in Venice (offers rooms for three people with separate beds).\\n\\n### Recommendation:\\nTo find accommodations that meet your specific requirements (3 rooms, 2 bathrooms, 3 people, 3 nights), it is best to:\\n- Use hotel booking platforms like Booking.com or Hotels.com and filter for your needs.\\n- Contact hotels directly to confirm room configurations and bathroom availability.\\n- Consider vacation rentals for more flexibility in room and bathroom arrangements.']\n",

But “quick\" doesn\\'t necessarily mean cheap—the cost of a three-day weekend for a family of four can quickly add up, whether you\\'re headed to the beach, the mountains, or the city.\\nBelow, we\\'ll take a look at the average cost of a three-day getaway for a family of four in the northeast United States. Feeling sticker shock? Fear not: We\\'ll share a variety of options to help you save money on your next weekend trip.\\n\\nLodging\\nAccommodations can rapidly eat up any travel budget. But if you\\'re flexible, this is also an area where you can find savings.\\nThe average daily hotel rate in the U.S. is about $180, or $540 for three nights. But rates vary depending on where you\\'re headed and when you\\'re traveling. Hotel rooms in a major city, during summertime peaks or over a holiday weekend will likely command higher prices.\\nThinking about booking an Airbnb in the northeast? Average prices per night hover around $200, or $600 for three nights, according to data from AllTheRooms:\\n\\nPennsylvania: $192\\nDelaware - $256\\nMaryland: $186\\nVirginia: $181\\nNew Jersey: $195\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re happy to forego creature comforts, tent camping at a state park is a fraction of the price of a hotel or vacation rental. Starting at $16 a night for in-state residents; you’ll pay a little more if you’re traveling out of state or during a weekend or holiday. \\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Consider the getaway you want as you compare options. If you simply need a place to sleep during a weekend of big-city tourism, a hotel may be more affordable than an Airbnb. If you prefer to cook your own meals and kick back at your home base, an Airbnb might be the cheaper choice.\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nAir travel is the most expensive way to get from point A to point B, costing around $406 per person for domestic flights out of Philadelphia and $352 out of Baltimore—that\\'s $1,625 and $1,408, respectively, for a family of four.\\n\\nDriving is the cheapest way to travel: If the average gas price per gallon is $3.80 and you embark on a 400-mile round trip, you’re looking at $52 in gas to transport the whole family (assuming 29 miles to the gallon).  Calculate your own gas estimate  and review average gas prices by state before you travel to get an idea of what to budget.\\n\\nAnother option: Rail travel. The average Amtrak fare sits around $72 per person, or $288 for a family of four. While that\\'s pricier than driving, it\\'s a bargain compared to flying.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Drive to your destination if you want to avoid purchasing costly flights for the whole family. If you\\'re open to spending a little more, traveling by train also provides a unique way to see the country and enjoy the journey to your destination—plus, you avoid pulling over for bathroom breaks and the inevitable impulse snack purchase.\\n\\nFood\\n\\nHow much will you spend on food during a three-day vacation? That depends on whether you have an appetite for fine dining or you prefer grab-and-go meals from the grocery store.\\n\\nSome estimates place the average daily meal cost around $104 for a single person, that’s $417 for a family of four and just over $1200 for three days. But that assumes you\\'re dining out for every meal.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: If you can\\'t stomach the thought of spending over $1,000 to eat for three days, there are endless ways to save money on food while you travel: Stay at a hotel with a continental breakfast, for instance, or pack your own snacks and water bottles.\\n\\nActivities\\nA day at the museum can cost anywhere from $0 to over $100 for a family of four. Art museum tickets range from free to nearly $30 apiece at museums across the U.S.\\n\\nBut there are ways to save on cultural attractions, including museums. Take advantage of free admission days to get the whole family in at no cost. Some attractions allow kids to visit for free, and others offer student discounts for young visitors. Beyond museums, prices vary for local attractions. \\nMoney-saving tip: You might find discounts on attractions during the off season or at quiet times of day: Hershey Park offers discounted “happy hour\" tickets after 4 p.m., for example.\\xa0\\n\\nSave or splurge: The choice is yours\\nA three-day weekend can be as affordable or ritzy as your budget allows. If your goal is to save money, do your research to find the right accommodations, transportation options, and activities for both your family and your wallet.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLabor Day weekend may have you dreaming about taking a quick getaway with the family. But “quick\" doesn\\'t necessarily mean cheap—the cost of a three-day weekend for a family of four can quickly add up, whether you\\'re headed to the beach, the mountains, or the city.\\nBelow, we\\'ll take a look at the average cost of a three-day getaway for a family of four in the northeast United States. Feeling sticker shock? Fear not: We\\'ll share a variety of options to help you save money on your next weekend trip.\\nAccommodations can rapidly eat up any travel budget. But if you\\'re flexible, this is also an area where you can find savings.\\nThe average daily hotel rate in the U.S. is about $180, or $540 for three nights. But rates vary depending on where you\\'re headed and when you\\'re traveling. Hotel rooms in a major city, during summertime peaks or over a holiday weekend will likely command higher prices.\\nThinking about booking an Airbnb in the northeast? Average prices per night hover around $200, or $600 for three nights, according to data from AllTheRooms:\\n\\nIf you\\'re happy to forego creature comforts, tent camping at a state park is a fraction of the price of a hotel or vacation rental. Starting at $16 a night for in-state residents; you’ll pay a little more if you’re traveling out of state or during a weekend or holiday. \\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Consider the getaway you want as you compare options. If you simply need a place to sleep during a weekend of big-city tourism, a hotel may be more affordable than an Airbnb. If you prefer to cook your own meals and kick back at your home base, an Airbnb might be the cheaper choice.\\n\\nAir travel is the most expensive way to get from point A to point B, costing around $406 per person for domestic flights out of Philadelphia and $352 out of Baltimore—that\\'s $1,625 and $1,408, respectively, for a family of four.\\n\\nDriving is the cheapest way to travel: If the average gas price per gallon is $3.80 and you embark on a 400-mile round trip, you’re looking at $52 in gas to transport the whole family (assuming 29 miles to the gallon).  Calculate your own gas estimate  and review average gas prices by state before you travel to get an idea of what to budget.\\n\\nAnother option: Rail travel. The average Amtrak fare sits around $72 per person, or $288 for a family of four. While that\\'s pricier than driving, it\\'s a bargain compared to flying.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Drive to your destination if you want to avoid purchasing costly flights for the whole family. If you\\'re open to spending a little more, traveling by train also provides a unique way to see the country and enjoy the journey to your destination—plus, you avoid pulling over for bathroom breaks and the inevitable impulse snack purchase.\\n\\nHow much will you spend on food during a three-day vacation?

A professional journalist, he joined the comp...\\n    \\nHere at Thrifty Traveler, we're all about cheap flights. But traveling on the cheap goes beyond airfare: Hotel costs can add up even faster. Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons. For one, they can be a saving grace when hotel rates are too high. Often, you can find better value booking an entire apartment than you can booking a tiny hotel room.\\xa0Plus, if you're traveling with a group, Airbnbs can help you stay together in a place with a shared kitchen and living spaces.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf something like that is more your speed, then use both Vrbo and Airbnb to start your search. Both websites operate similarly and can be searched with a long list of filters and using the map.\\nVacation rental websites like these are a great way to find a special, unique stay as well.

It’s either that or outside in a hammock. But never at a hotel…\\nThat’s where you’re wrong! Cheap hotel chains in the USA are plentiful. Better than that though, they’re cheap!\\nThe best budget hotels chains in the US are truly excellent pieces of accommodation and not to be overlooked. They offer a fantastic alternative to the classic choices of budget stays for domestic travellers in America. Instead of staying somewhere completely derelict or somewhere fiendishly expensive (or somewhere in the woods), you can get yourself a cheap sleep and a hot shower somewhere comfy!\\nHowever, we’ve all heard the sordid stories of America’s cheapest hotels and motels. Hushed whispers in dank corridors of “hard, feculent motel pillows”…\\nNot all the cheap hotel chains in the USA are going to be somewhere you want to spend a night. Some are just downright putrid! Others are simply intended for the more questionable activities of the night.\\nNever fear though—you have this guide: a comprehensive comparison of the best budget hotel chains in the USA. I’ve done the hard work researching which cheap hotel chains are really deserving of your cash. We have winners, runner-ups, honourable mentions, and everything in between, so let’s get this show on the road!\\nWe’ll leave no feculent motel pillow unturned in our search for the ULTIMATE marshmallow mattress… at a reasonable price.\\nThe Broke Backpacker is supported by you. Clicking through our links may earn us a small affiliate commission, and that's what allows us to keep producing free content 🙂 Learn more.\\nWe’re now running through the top picks of America’s most affordable hotel chains. Despite what you may have heard, not all cheap hotels in the USA are dens of debauchery and decay.\\nNay, these babies are sparkly clean and lined with the amenities to keep a smile on any soulful bachelor’s face! Standards are high and renovations and refurbishments are surprisingly regular amongst most of these listings.\\nWhile all these chains top out customer satisfaction surveys on the regular, it’s really unfair to call any ‘the best’. They all do something different, they all do it well, and they’re all worthy of a booking for it!\\nSo in the order of most awesome to equally most awesome—with a little something for every frugal holidayer and tight-assed traveller exploring the US on a budget—here are the best budget hotel chains in the USA.\\nPop your email in below to get a FREE copy of ‘How to Travel the World on $10 a Day!’.\\n\\nΔ\\n\\nAnyone who’s spent some time on America’s byways and highways has encountered a Motel 6 at this point (they are ubiquitous in American motel culture). You could call it a discount hotel chain, you could could it a budget motel chain, but the point is that they’re cheap and they have plenty of beds!\\nWhat they don’t have is any extra platitudes. Free WiFi and brekky are simply not gonna be a thing most of the time (although free coffee in the morning IS a thing and ALWAYS appreciated).\\nSo if Motel 6 is lacking in bells and whistles, what’s the point? I mean, I really can’t reiterate enough just how cheap these guys are.\\xa0\\nRelative to the other options on this list (and across America), you won’t find much cheaper—they’re easily one of the best budget hotel chains in the USA for travellers strictly looking for budget. They also allow up to two pets per room at no extra cost which is honestly quite impressive and gracious.\\xa0\\nCurrently, Motel 6 is in the process of refurbishing its 1200+ properties across numerous the USA’s famous and lesser-famous destinations. Watch the space because while the prices aren’t going up, the living standards are!\\nA supremely basic and cheap place to stay right on the doorstep of the Grand Canyon National Park! There's free parking for the road trippers, free coffee for the brew hounds, and an indoor pool for everybody else.\\n\\nAhh, Microtel… Microtel makes the cut for most budget hotel brand roundups and with good reason—they rock!\\nNow, as far as budget hotel chains go, they aren’t strictly the cheapest, but that’s also kinda the point. The rooms are smaller, but they’re also more luxurious. They aren’t the cheapest, but they also aren’t the most expensive…\\nIt’s the sweet, majestic middleman.\\nOwned by the Wyndham Hotel Group (a name you’re going to see repeated on this more than once), Microtel Inn & Suites has always been a top contender of the best economy hotel chains in America, however, since their acquisition by Wyndham, they’ve only become more consistent!\\nIf you’re looking for the true no-frills experience, look elsewhere. Microtel’s rooms may be a touch… micro… but they’re also decked with a lotta nice trimmings. They’re the perfect choice for anyone looking to live cheaply and with some privacy but a touch above the true budget traveller lifestyle.\\nGet a cheap yet blissful night's sleep in the mountainous resort city of Pigeon Forge! Only 15 minutes drive from the Smoky Mountains National Park, spend your days exploring the region (after a free breakfast) before returning for a dip in the outdoor pool. It's the perfect balance of luxury to budget-friendly!\\n\\nWyndham is at it again with another kickass economy hotel chain! With nearly 100 years of history behind it, the Travelodge hotel chain has been taking care of frugal travellers’ needs for a long-long while.\\nTravelodge accommodations tend to be very well located. There are even a number of Travelodges neatly situated around some of the USA’s most famous national parks making it perfect for anyone on a tour of the Great American Wilderness.\\nGenerally speaking, right around the board, they offer mint rooms for the price of entry. King-size beds, workspaces, full-power showers, and, yes, internet connectivity. Sometimes there are charging ports by the bed, blackout curtains, LED lighting, and other finishing touches that make you go “Ooh, that’s nice.”\\nThe long and short of it—they’re just one of the best economy hotel chains in the US. A solid all-rounder from start to finish. AND (for the cherry on top), every location has an on-site bar.\\nCheers to that!\\nOne of the cheapest places to stay close to Yellowstone National Park—only 25 minutes drive from Mammoth Hot Springs! Rooms are surprisingly spacious (particularly if you nab one with a kitchenette), and the mountain views just tie the package together perfectly.\\nWant to save money on accommodation?\\nEnjoy 15% OFF on stays ALL around the world.\\n\\nWyndham you sneaky devils. The aces up your sleeve just keep coming!\\nSuper 8 is Wyndham’s ultra-budget answer to Motel 6. The prices are still low, albeit a touch higher than Motel 6’s, but you get wayyy more bang for your buck. WiFi is included, as is the continental breakfast, and the rooms are generally splashier than Motel 6.\\nPrices have crept a bit higher over the last few years, but that seems to be reflective of the constant renovations taking place at many of Super 8’s locations across the USA. Overall, Super 8 isn’t the cheapest hotel chain in America, but it’s far from expensive and offers a lot for what you pay.\\nThe choice between a Motel 6 or a Super 8 really just comes down to your budget and how much you like the extra creature comforts… and WiFi. It’s all about that WiFi.\\nPool, breakfast, nice rooms… these things are all great, however, how about an on-site casino right inside the hotel! Still not tickling your fancies? Then maybe the on-site pizza and sub shop inside the casino will do the trick!\\n\\nOver a short 13-year span, this budget friendly hotel chain has grown from a meagre 2 listings to a whopping 1000+ opulent locales at a fair price! In fact, prior to Microtel’s acquisition by Wyndham (and subsequent refinement), America’s Best Value Inn was topping most customer surveys on the best value hotel chains in the US.\\nFree breakfast, WiFi, and parking are standard at most of their locations, and the internet is cracking fast. That—combined with the in-house meeting rooms throughout their constantly expanding network—make it a favourite with the travelling business sorts.\\nGiven how quickly this hotel chain has both expanded AND shot up through the ranks of customer satisfaction, you definitely won’t go wrong booking a budget stay in one of their esteemed guestrooms. They’ve even got a pool to take a dip in before you head to your room for that steamy evening shower!\\nIt's probably not necessarily the nicest America's Best Value Inn, however, being only a 10-minute walk from Disneyland, who's to complain? The guest rooms have got a few extra trimmings to make this an extra sweet deal, and there are even discount tickets for Disneyland available at reception!\\nIf you’re deciding where to stay in Anaheim, this inn is great value – especially considering it’s proximity to the infamous Disneyland!\\n\\nSo, Candlewood Suites is broaching into midscale territory, however, I’m such a fan of what they’re about that I just have to mention them. Candlewood Suites is the best inexpensive hotel chain for long-stayers!\\nEach suite comes with a fully-equipped kitchen decked out and ready for cooking some cost-effective meals from the comfort of your room. With choices between studios and one-bedroom rooms for solo travellers or the larger suites for families and couples, there really is something for everyone at Candlewood Suites.\\nMost locations have parking, including truck parking for the roadwarriors (meaning those planning an RV trip will find themselves some spacious spots too). Plus (if you are doing those longe interstate drives), you’ll find a pool at most Candlewood Suites locations for a dip at the end of the day.\\nOR, for one better, a hot tub! Now that’s something most cheap hotels in America certainly do not offer!\\nDude, you're five minutes from Times Square smack bang right in the heart of Manhattan. There's an on-site fitness centre AND business centre (plus the rooms are certainly flash), however, just taking a healthy and scrumptious bite of the Big Apple life is more than enough reason to book this hotel!\\n\\nHoliday Inn Express is not exactly cheap, but it’s still oen of the most affordable hotel chains in the USA. It’s a great choice for travellers who have a bit more money to spend but still want to keep the trip budget friendly.\\nRooms are relatively small, making this chain particularly great for business travellers who won’t be in their rooms often. Each room is well designed with modern furniture, free wifi, coffee and tea.\\nYou can also expect free breakfast – which is much-loved by guests and goes above and beyond your typical hotel buffet.\\nWith thousands of properties across the States AND the world, you’ll find a wide variety of amenities from outdoor pools to fitness centers and room service. Plus, it’s super safe – you won’t get any seedy motel vibes here!\\nThere's a colourful pool deck, a delicious and convenient buffet breakfast… plus we can't forget the obvious: YOU'RE IN HAWAII! You'll get to enjoy spacious rooms (some of which have an ocean view), and remain firmly within walking distance from just about everything Honolulu has to offer. While its not as cheap as other Holiday Inn Express locations, it is a remote island chain after all.\\n\\nLook for the trademark red roof and chances are you’ve found a Red Roof Inn! Despite having over 500 locations across the States, they are still one of the lesser-widespread cheap hotel chains in America. So what makes them worth the booking?\\nWell, free brekky and WiFi at most of their establishments certainly ain’t bad! Rooms generally are equipped with workspaces (along with the aforementioned free WiFi) making it a good choice for people working on the road.\\nAnd speaking of the road, Red Roof Inn accommodations are an excellent choice of a hotel chain for road trips across the USA. They’re cheap, they offer a decent night’s sleep following a long day’s drive, and best of all…\\nThey allow pets! Well, pet. One pet per room. You won’t exactly be able to start a menagerie in your budget hotel room, but at least you’ll have a friend!\\nRed Roof Inns are now also offering Red Roof Plus rooms—$15 extra a night scores you a bit more luxury in your lap. Perhaps it’s not totally worth the extra dollars, however, you can’t deny the rooms look mighty sleek.\\nOnly a short way from the airport is this cheap stay and springboard for exploring Florida state. It's a clean but basic place to stay, but the cheap price, central location, and on-site gym kick it up a notch. Besides, score yourself a room with a hot tub and you'll be living the high-flier's lifestyle on a low-flier's wage!\\nWanna know how to pack like a pro? Well for a start you need the right gear….\\nThese are packing cubes for the globetrotters and compression sacks for the\\xa0real adventurers – these babies are a traveller’s best kept secret. They organise yo’ packing and minimise volume too so you can pack MORE.\\nOr, y’know… you can stick to just chucking it all in your backpack…\\nDriving the West Coast, East Coast, or all the way to Argentina—doesn’t matter! The laws of booking a cheap hotel are pretty universal.\\nPlan well, book far in advance, and reward points are your friend.\\nBooking.com. I mean there are plenty of other excellent sites for booking hotels, however, nine times out of ten, you’ll probably end up booking through Booking.com.\\nBooking.com has an incredible range of places to stay and, in particular, types of places to stay. It’s not just hotels—apartments, guest houses, homestays, treehouses, geodesic wonder-domes… There’s something for every holiday!\\nThey get solid discounts on the regular too, both for last-minute scores or for rabid itinerary planners who like to book early. They’re not perfect—the interface behaves like a bit of a wiener and they really have a lockdown on the lion’s share of the market (which is never really a good thing).\\nHowever, most times when scouring for cheap chain hotels, chances are it’ll end up being through Booking.com. They’re the gold standard for a reason.\\nPast that, there are a few other mentions to keep in mind. Though most budget hotels can be found on Booking.com, savvy consumers don’t put all their eggs in one basket—you gotta spread that love around! You never know when a different hotel booking platform is going to have the same (or similar) budget hotel at a smidgen cheaper.\\nOther baskets to put your love into include:\\nA long, long time ago, I had a whole stockpile of reward points for a major supermarket chain banked up. Then, breakups happened; my ex whisked herself off with all my waiting freebies just before the Christmas shopping season. Now, I don’t know what she did with those points, but whatever it was, I can guarantee it was black-hearted and evil!\\nWhat’s the moral of the story? Bitchez be cray! Use your reward points!\\nA staple of America’s thriving motel scene, you can save a lot on most of the best hotel chains in the USA with their in-house loyalty programs. (And the cheap hotel chains are just the same!) Book enough nights or often enough and soon you’ll find yourself the proud recipient of a free night stay.\\nMost budget hotel chains have some sort of rewards system, and they tend to be pretty easy to sign up for. Usually, a quick Google or chat at the reception will get the job done.\\nFor the hotel chains that we’ve covered in this article…\\nLastly, if you’re a total point scrounger, then investing in a credit card that stacks up the reward points is a smart idea too. Both the Capital One Venture Rewards Card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card can earn you some seriously sexy savings on a whole bunch of travel-related things  (including accommodation booking or even flights).\\nIf you’re really looking for the cheapest stays across America’s hotel chains, it’s all about them points.\\nSee—it’s not all wicked dens of heathenry and unwashed linens! There are plenty of stellar budget hotel chains in the USA that makes travelling the States affordable–there are even a few we didn’t mention like Best Western, Days Inn, Sleep Inn, and the Hampton Inn. Yes, the USA does love its Inns!\\nCompetition is fierce in the market, and that breeds higher standards. The more our favourite budget hotel brands renovate and refurbish, the nicer things become. Prices may creep higher, however, cheap is still the goal (and usually the reality).\\nIn a world of Airbnb and the sharing economy, hotels are finding themself less-and-less the star of holidayers’ dream getaways. Similarly, sites like Booking.com and Agoda are branching out from hotels and increasingly pitching themselves as an alternative to Airbnb (among the growing market of sites doing things like Airbnb).\\nStill, there will always be a place for the humble budget hotel chain amongst the deserts, rivers, and mountains of the American landscape. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of driving 8+ hours across the wastes only to sight that motel signage heralding a cheerful night’s rest on a hard, feculent pillow.\\nAnd until we’re paying hourly rates at motels for whatever your—ahem—‘needs’ might be (thank you, Colombia, for this winning innovation), that’ll do just fine.\\nA couple of you lovely readers suggested we set up a tip jar for direct support as an alternative to booking through our links.

But “quick\" doesn\\'t necessarily mean cheap—the cost of a three-day weekend for a family of four can quickly add up, whether you\\'re headed to the beach, the mountains, or the city.\\nBelow, we\\'ll take a look at the average cost of a three-day getaway for a family of four in the northeast United States. Feeling sticker shock? Fear not: We\\'ll share a variety of options to help you save money on your next weekend trip.\\n\\nLodging\\nAccommodations can rapidly eat up any travel budget. But if you\\'re flexible, this is also an area where you can find savings.\\nThe average daily hotel rate in the U.S. is about $180, or $540 for three nights. But rates vary depending on where you\\'re headed and when you\\'re traveling. Hotel rooms in a major city, during summertime peaks or over a holiday weekend will likely command higher prices.\\nThinking about booking an Airbnb in the northeast? Average prices per night hover around $200, or $600 for three nights, according to data from AllTheRooms:\\n\\nPennsylvania: $192\\nDelaware - $256\\nMaryland: $186\\nVirginia: $181\\nNew Jersey: $195\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re happy to forego creature comforts, tent camping at a state park is a fraction of the price of a hotel or vacation rental. Starting at $16 a night for in-state residents; you’ll pay a little more if you’re traveling out of state or during a weekend or holiday. \\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Consider the getaway you want as you compare options. If you simply need a place to sleep during a weekend of big-city tourism, a hotel may be more affordable than an Airbnb. If you prefer to cook your own meals and kick back at your home base, an Airbnb might be the cheaper choice.\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nAir travel is the most expensive way to get from point A to point B, costing around $406 per person for domestic flights out of Philadelphia and $352 out of Baltimore—that\\'s $1,625 and $1,408, respectively, for a family of four.\\n\\nDriving is the cheapest way to travel: If the average gas price per gallon is $3.80 and you embark on a 400-mile round trip, you’re looking at $52 in gas to transport the whole family (assuming 29 miles to the gallon).  Calculate your own gas estimate  and review average gas prices by state before you travel to get an idea of what to budget.\\n\\nAnother option: Rail travel. The average Amtrak fare sits around $72 per person, or $288 for a family of four. While that\\'s pricier than driving, it\\'s a bargain compared to flying.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Drive to your destination if you want to avoid purchasing costly flights for the whole family. If you\\'re open to spending a little more, traveling by train also provides a unique way to see the country and enjoy the journey to your destination—plus, you avoid pulling over for bathroom breaks and the inevitable impulse snack purchase.\\n\\nFood\\n\\nHow much will you spend on food during a three-day vacation? That depends on whether you have an appetite for fine dining or you prefer grab-and-go meals from the grocery store.\\n\\nSome estimates place the average daily meal cost around $104 for a single person, that’s $417 for a family of four and just over $1200 for three days. But that assumes you\\'re dining out for every meal.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: If you can\\'t stomach the thought of spending over $1,000 to eat for three days, there are endless ways to save money on food while you travel: Stay at a hotel with a continental breakfast, for instance, or pack your own snacks and water bottles.\\n\\nActivities\\nA day at the museum can cost anywhere from $0 to over $100 for a family of four. Art museum tickets range from free to nearly $30 apiece at museums across the U.S.\\n\\nBut there are ways to save on cultural attractions, including museums. Take advantage of free admission days to get the whole family in at no cost. Some attractions allow kids to visit for free, and others offer student discounts for young visitors. Beyond museums, prices vary for local attractions. \\nMoney-saving tip: You might find discounts on attractions during the off season or at quiet times of day: Hershey Park offers discounted “happy hour\" tickets after 4 p.m., for example.\\xa0\\n\\nSave or splurge: The choice is yours\\nA three-day weekend can be as affordable or ritzy as your budget allows.

Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons. For one, they can be a saving grace when hotel rates are too high. Often, you can find better value booking an entire apartment than you can booking a tiny hotel room.\\xa0Plus, if you're traveling with a group, Airbnbs can help you stay together in a place with a shared kitchen and living spaces.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf something like that is more your speed, then use both Vrbo and Airbnb to start your search. Both websites operate similarly and can be searched with a long list of filters and using the map.\\nVacation rental websites like these are a great way to find a special, unique stay as well. Want something with a little bit of charm instead of a sterile hotel room? Live in someone's home!\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFinding the best hotel booking site and the sweetest hotel deals doesn't have to be stressful. A single best website to book hotels doesn't truly exist, but there are tons of great accommodation booking sites that could lead you right to the perfect place to stay on your next trip.\\nThe best hotel deals can be found at any of these 17 hotel reservation websites… plus a few more!

It’s either that or outside in a hammock. But never at a hotel…\\nThat’s where you’re wrong! Cheap hotel chains in the USA are plentiful. Better than that though, they’re cheap!\\nThe best budget hotels chains in the US are truly excellent pieces of accommodation and not to be overlooked. They offer a fantastic alternative to the classic choices of budget stays for domestic travellers in America. Instead of staying somewhere completely derelict or somewhere fiendishly expensive (or somewhere in the woods), you can get yourself a cheap sleep and a hot shower somewhere comfy!\\nHowever, we’ve all heard the sordid stories of America’s cheapest hotels and motels. Hushed whispers in dank corridors of “hard, feculent motel pillows”…\\nNot all the cheap hotel chains in the USA are going to be somewhere you want to spend a night. Some are just downright putrid! Others are simply intended for the more questionable activities of the night.\\nNever fear though—you have this guide: a comprehensive comparison of the best budget hotel chains in the USA. I’ve done the hard work researching which cheap hotel chains are really deserving of your cash. We have winners, runner-ups, honourable mentions, and everything in between, so let’s get this show on the road!\\nWe’ll leave no feculent motel pillow unturned in our search for the ULTIMATE marshmallow mattress… at a reasonable price.\\nThe Broke Backpacker is supported by you. Clicking through our links may earn us a small affiliate commission, and that's what allows us to keep producing free content 🙂 Learn more.\\nWe’re now running through the top picks of America’s most affordable hotel chains. Despite what you may have heard, not all cheap hotels in the USA are dens of debauchery and decay.\\nNay, these babies are sparkly clean and lined with the amenities to keep a smile on any soulful bachelor’s face! Standards are high and renovations and refurbishments are surprisingly regular amongst most of these listings.\\nWhile all these chains top out customer satisfaction surveys on the regular, it’s really unfair to call any ‘the best’. They all do something different, they all do it well, and they’re all worthy of a booking for it!\\nSo in the order of most awesome to equally most awesome—with a little something for every frugal holidayer and tight-assed traveller exploring the US on a budget—here are the best budget hotel chains in the USA.\\nPop your email in below to get a FREE copy of ‘How to Travel the World on $10 a Day!’.\\n\\nΔ\\n\\nAnyone who’s spent some time on America’s byways and highways has encountered a Motel 6 at this point (they are ubiquitous in American motel culture). You could call it a discount hotel chain, you could could it a budget motel chain, but the point is that they’re cheap and they have plenty of beds!\\nWhat they don’t have is any extra platitudes. Free WiFi and brekky are simply not gonna be a thing most of the time (although free coffee in the morning IS a thing and ALWAYS appreciated).\\nSo if Motel 6 is lacking in bells and whistles, what’s the point? I mean, I really can’t reiterate enough just how cheap these guys are.\\xa0\\nRelative to the other options on this list (and across America), you won’t find much cheaper—they’re easily one of the best budget hotel chains in the USA for travellers strictly looking for budget. They also allow up to two pets per room at no extra cost which is honestly quite impressive and gracious.\\xa0\\nCurrently, Motel 6 is in the process of refurbishing its 1200+ properties across numerous the USA’s famous and lesser-famous destinations. Watch the space because while the prices aren’t going up, the living standards are!\\nA supremely basic and cheap place to stay right on the doorstep of the Grand Canyon National Park! There's free parking for the road trippers, free coffee for the brew hounds, and an indoor pool for everybody else.\\n\\nAhh, Microtel… Microtel makes the cut for most budget hotel brand roundups and with good reason—they rock!\\nNow, as far as budget hotel chains go, they aren’t strictly the cheapest, but that’s also kinda the point. The rooms are smaller, but they’re also more luxurious. They aren’t the cheapest, but they also aren’t the most expensive…\\nIt’s the sweet, majestic middleman.\\nOwned by the Wyndham Hotel Group (a name you’re going to see repeated on this more than once), Microtel Inn & Suites has always been a top contender of the best economy hotel chains in America, however, since their acquisition by Wyndham, they’ve only become more consistent!\\nIf you’re looking for the true no-frills experience, look elsewhere. Microtel’s rooms may be a touch… micro… but they’re also decked with a lotta nice trimmings. They’re the perfect choice for anyone looking to live cheaply and with some privacy but a touch above the true budget traveller lifestyle.\\nGet a cheap yet blissful night's sleep in the mountainous resort city of Pigeon Forge! Only 15 minutes drive from the Smoky Mountains National Park, spend your days exploring the region (after a free breakfast) before returning for a dip in the outdoor pool. It's the perfect balance of luxury to budget-friendly!\\n\\nWyndham is at it again with another kickass economy hotel chain! With nearly 100 years of history behind it, the Travelodge hotel chain has been taking care of frugal travellers’ needs for a long-long while.\\nTravelodge accommodations tend to be very well located. There are even a number of Travelodges neatly situated around some of the USA’s most famous national parks making it perfect for anyone on a tour of the Great American Wilderness.\\nGenerally speaking, right around the board, they offer mint rooms for the price of entry. King-size beds, workspaces, full-power showers, and, yes, internet connectivity. Sometimes there are charging ports by the bed, blackout curtains, LED lighting, and other finishing touches that make you go “Ooh, that’s nice.”\\nThe long and short of it—they’re just one of the best economy hotel chains in the US. A solid all-rounder from start to finish. AND (for the cherry on top), every location has an on-site bar.\\nCheers to that!\\nOne of the cheapest places to stay close to Yellowstone National Park—only 25 minutes drive from Mammoth Hot Springs! Rooms are surprisingly spacious (particularly if you nab one with a kitchenette), and the mountain views just tie the package together perfectly.\\nWant to save money on accommodation?\\nEnjoy 15% OFF on stays ALL around the world.\\n\\nWyndham you sneaky devils. The aces up your sleeve just keep coming!\\nSuper 8 is Wyndham’s ultra-budget answer to Motel 6. The prices are still low, albeit a touch higher than Motel 6’s, but you get wayyy more bang for your buck. WiFi is included, as is the continental breakfast, and the rooms are generally splashier than Motel 6.\\nPrices have crept a bit higher over the last few years, but that seems to be reflective of the constant renovations taking place at many of Super 8’s locations across the USA. Overall, Super 8 isn’t the cheapest hotel chain in America, but it’s far from expensive and offers a lot for what you pay.\\nThe choice between a Motel 6 or a Super 8 really just comes down to your budget and how much you like the extra creature comforts… and WiFi. It’s all about that WiFi.\\nPool, breakfast, nice rooms… these things are all great, however, how about an on-site casino right inside the hotel! Still not tickling your fancies? Then maybe the on-site pizza and sub shop inside the casino will do the trick!\\n\\nOver a short 13-year span, this budget friendly hotel chain has grown from a meagre 2 listings to a whopping 1000+ opulent locales at a fair price! In fact, prior to Microtel’s acquisition by Wyndham (and subsequent refinement), America’s Best Value Inn was topping most customer surveys on the best value hotel chains in the US.\\nFree breakfast, WiFi, and parking are standard at most of their locations, and the internet is cracking fast. That—combined with the in-house meeting rooms throughout their constantly expanding network—make it a favourite with the travelling business sorts.\\nGiven how quickly this hotel chain has both expanded AND shot up through the ranks of customer satisfaction, you definitely won’t go wrong booking a budget stay in one of their esteemed guestrooms. They’ve even got a pool to take a dip in before you head to your room for that steamy evening shower!\\nIt's probably not necessarily the nicest America's Best Value Inn, however, being only a 10-minute walk from Disneyland, who's to complain? The guest rooms have got a few extra trimmings to make this an extra sweet deal, and there are even discount tickets for Disneyland available at reception!\\nIf you’re deciding where to stay in Anaheim, this inn is great value – especially considering it’s proximity to the infamous Disneyland!\\n\\nSo, Candlewood Suites is broaching into midscale territory, however, I’m such a fan of what they’re about that I just have to mention them. Candlewood Suites is the best inexpensive hotel chain for long-stayers!\\nEach suite comes with a fully-equipped kitchen decked out and ready for cooking some cost-effective meals from the comfort of your room. With choices between studios and one-bedroom rooms for solo travellers or the larger suites for families and couples, there really is something for everyone at Candlewood Suites.\\nMost locations have parking, including truck parking for the roadwarriors (meaning those planning an RV trip will find themselves some spacious spots too). Plus (if you are doing those longe interstate drives), you’ll find a pool at most Candlewood Suites locations for a dip at the end of the day.\\nOR, for one better, a hot tub! Now that’s something most cheap hotels in America certainly do not offer!\\nDude, you're five minutes from Times Square smack bang right in the heart of Manhattan. There's an on-site fitness centre AND business centre (plus the rooms are certainly flash), however, just taking a healthy and scrumptious bite of the Big Apple life is more than enough reason to book this hotel!\\n\\nHoliday Inn Express is not exactly cheap, but it’s still oen of the most affordable hotel chains in the USA. It’s a great choice for travellers who have a bit more money to spend but still want to keep the trip budget friendly.\\nRooms are relatively small, making this chain particularly great for business travellers who won’t be in their rooms often. Each room is well designed with modern furniture, free wifi, coffee and tea.\\nYou can also expect free breakfast – which is much-loved by guests and goes above and beyond your typical hotel buffet.\\nWith thousands of properties across the States AND the world, you’ll find a wide variety of amenities from outdoor pools to fitness centers and room service. Plus, it’s super safe – you won’t get any seedy motel vibes here!\\nThere's a colourful pool deck, a delicious and convenient buffet breakfast… plus we can't forget the obvious: YOU'RE IN HAWAII! You'll get to enjoy spacious rooms (some of which have an ocean view), and remain firmly within walking distance from just about everything Honolulu has to offer. While its not as cheap as other Holiday Inn Express locations, it is a remote island chain after all.\\n\\nLook for the trademark red roof and chances are you’ve found a Red Roof Inn! Despite having over 500 locations across the States, they are still one of the lesser-widespread cheap hotel chains in America. So what makes them worth the booking?\\nWell, free brekky and WiFi at most of their establishments certainly ain’t bad! Rooms generally are equipped with workspaces (along with the aforementioned free WiFi) making it a good choice for people working on the road.\\nAnd speaking of the road, Red Roof Inn accommodations are an excellent choice of a hotel chain for road trips across the USA. They’re cheap, they offer a decent night’s sleep following a long day’s drive, and best of all…\\nThey allow pets! Well, pet. One pet per room. You won’t exactly be able to start a menagerie in your budget hotel room, but at least you’ll have a friend!\\nRed Roof Inns are now also offering Red Roof Plus rooms—$15 extra a night scores you a bit more luxury in your lap. Perhaps it’s not totally worth the extra dollars, however, you can’t deny the rooms look mighty sleek.\\nOnly a short way from the airport is this cheap stay and springboard for exploring Florida state. It's a clean but basic place to stay, but the cheap price, central location, and on-site gym kick it up a notch. Besides, score yourself a room with a hot tub and you'll be living the high-flier's lifestyle on a low-flier's wage!\\nWanna know how to pack like a pro? Well for a start you need the right gear….\\nThese are packing cubes for the globetrotters and compression sacks for the\\xa0real adventurers – these babies are a traveller’s best kept secret. They organise yo’ packing and minimise volume too so you can pack MORE.\\nOr, y’know… you can stick to just chucking it all in your backpack…\\nDriving the West Coast, East Coast, or all the way to Argentina—doesn’t matter! The laws of booking a cheap hotel are pretty universal.\\nPlan well, book far in advance, and reward points are your friend.\\nBooking.com. I mean there are plenty of other excellent sites for booking hotels, however, nine times out of ten, you’ll probably end up booking through Booking.com.\\nBooking.com has an incredible range of places to stay and, in particular, types of places to stay. It’s not just hotels—apartments, guest houses, homestays, treehouses, geodesic wonder-domes… There’s something for every holiday!\\nThey get solid discounts on the regular too, both for last-minute scores or for rabid itinerary planners who like to book early. They’re not perfect—the interface behaves like a bit of a wiener and they really have a lockdown on the lion’s share of the market (which is never really a good thing).\\nHowever, most times when scouring for cheap chain hotels, chances are it’ll end up being through Booking.com. They’re the gold standard for a reason.\\nPast that, there are a few other mentions to keep in mind. Though most budget hotels can be found on Booking.com, savvy consumers don’t put all their eggs in one basket—you gotta spread that love around! You never know when a different hotel booking platform is going to have the same (or similar) budget hotel at a smidgen cheaper.\\nOther baskets to put your love into include:\\nA long, long time ago, I had a whole stockpile of reward points for a major supermarket chain banked up. Then, breakups happened; my ex whisked herself off with all my waiting freebies just before the Christmas shopping season. Now, I don’t know what she did with those points, but whatever it was, I can guarantee it was black-hearted and evil!\\nWhat’s the moral of the story? Bitchez be cray! Use your reward points!\\nA staple of America’s thriving motel scene, you can save a lot on most of the best hotel chains in the USA with their in-house loyalty programs. (And the cheap hotel chains are just the same!) Book enough nights or often enough and soon you’ll find yourself the proud recipient of a free night stay.\\nMost budget hotel chains have some sort of rewards system, and they tend to be pretty easy to sign up for. Usually, a quick Google or chat at the reception will get the job done.\\nFor the hotel chains that we’ve covered in this article…\\nLastly, if you’re a total point scrounger, then investing in a credit card that stacks up the reward points is a smart idea too. Both the Capital One Venture Rewards Card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card can earn you some seriously sexy savings on a whole bunch of travel-related things  (including accommodation booking or even flights).\\nIf you’re really looking for the cheapest stays across America’s hotel chains, it’s all about them points.\\nSee—it’s not all wicked dens of heathenry and unwashed linens! There are plenty of stellar budget hotel chains in the USA that makes travelling the States affordable–there are even a few we didn’t mention like Best Western, Days Inn, Sleep Inn, and the Hampton Inn. Yes, the USA does love its Inns!\\nCompetition is fierce in the market, and that breeds higher standards. The more our favourite budget hotel brands renovate and refurbish, the nicer things become. Prices may creep higher, however, cheap is still the goal (and usually the reality).\\nIn a world of Airbnb and the sharing economy, hotels are finding themself less-and-less the star of holidayers’ dream getaways. Similarly, sites like Booking.com and Agoda are branching out from hotels and increasingly pitching themselves as an alternative to Airbnb (among the growing market of sites doing things like Airbnb).\\nStill, there will always be a place for the humble budget hotel chain amongst the deserts, rivers, and mountains of the American landscape. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of driving 8+ hours across the wastes only to sight that motel signage heralding a cheerful night’s rest on a hard, feculent pillow.\\nAnd until we’re paying hourly rates at motels for whatever your—ahem—‘needs’ might be (thank you, Colombia, for this winning innovation), that’ll do just fine.\\nA couple of you lovely readers suggested we set up a tip jar for direct support as an alternative to booking through our links.

But “quick\" doesn\\'t necessarily mean cheap—the cost of a three-day weekend for a family of four can quickly add up, whether you\\'re headed to the beach, the mountains, or the city.\\nBelow, we\\'ll take a look at the average cost of a three-day getaway for a family of four in the northeast United States. Feeling sticker shock? Fear not: We\\'ll share a variety of options to help you save money on your next weekend trip.\\n\\nLodging\\nAccommodations can rapidly eat up any travel budget. But if you\\'re flexible, this is also an area where you can find savings.\\nThe average daily hotel rate in the U.S. is about $180, or $540 for three nights. But rates vary depending on where you\\'re headed and when you\\'re traveling. Hotel rooms in a major city, during summertime peaks or over a holiday weekend will likely command higher prices.\\nThinking about booking an Airbnb in the northeast? Average prices per night hover around $200, or $600 for three nights, according to data from AllTheRooms:\\n\\nPennsylvania: $192\\nDelaware - $256\\nMaryland: $186\\nVirginia: $181\\nNew Jersey: $195\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re happy to forego creature comforts, tent camping at a state park is a fraction of the price of a hotel or vacation rental. Starting at $16 a night for in-state residents; you’ll pay a little more if you’re traveling out of state or during a weekend or holiday. \\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Consider the getaway you want as you compare options. If you simply need a place to sleep during a weekend of big-city tourism, a hotel may be more affordable than an Airbnb. If you prefer to cook your own meals and kick back at your home base, an Airbnb might be the cheaper choice.\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nAir travel is the most expensive way to get from point A to point B, costing around $406 per person for domestic flights out of Philadelphia and $352 out of Baltimore—that\\'s $1,625 and $1,408, respectively, for a family of four.\\n\\nDriving is the cheapest way to travel: If the average gas price per gallon is $3.80 and you embark on a 400-mile round trip, you’re looking at $52 in gas to transport the whole family (assuming 29 miles to the gallon).  Calculate your own gas estimate  and review average gas prices by state before you travel to get an idea of what to budget.\\n\\nAnother option: Rail travel. The average Amtrak fare sits around $72 per person, or $288 for a family of four. While that\\'s pricier than driving, it\\'s a bargain compared to flying.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Drive to your destination if you want to avoid purchasing costly flights for the whole family. If you\\'re open to spending a little more, traveling by train also provides a unique way to see the country and enjoy the journey to your destination—plus, you avoid pulling over for bathroom breaks and the inevitable impulse snack purchase.\\n\\nFood\\n\\nHow much will you spend on food during a three-day vacation? That depends on whether you have an appetite for fine dining or you prefer grab-and-go meals from the grocery store.\\n\\nSome estimates place the average daily meal cost around $104 for a single person, that’s $417 for a family of four and just over $1200 for three days. But that assumes you\\'re dining out for every meal.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: If you can\\'t stomach the thought of spending over $1,000 to eat for three days, there are endless ways to save money on food while you travel: Stay at a hotel with a continental breakfast, for instance, or pack your own snacks and water bottles.\\n\\nActivities\\nA day at the museum can cost anywhere from $0 to over $100 for a family of four. Art museum tickets range from free to nearly $30 apiece at museums across the U.S.\\n\\nBut there are ways to save on cultural attractions, including museums. Take advantage of free admission days to get the whole family in at no cost. Some attractions allow kids to visit for free, and others offer student discounts for young visitors. Beyond museums, prices vary for local attractions. \\nMoney-saving tip: You might find discounts on attractions during the off season or at quiet times of day: Hershey Park offers discounted “happy hour\" tickets after 4 p.m., for example.\\xa0\\n\\nSave or splurge: The choice is yours\\nA three-day weekend can be as affordable or ritzy as your budget allows.

A professional journalist, he joined the comp...\\n    \\nHere at Thrifty Traveler, we're all about cheap flights. But traveling on the cheap goes beyond airfare: Hotel costs can add up even faster. Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons. For one, they can be a saving grace when hotel rates are too high. Often, you can find better value booking an entire apartment than you can booking a tiny hotel room.\\xa0Plus, if you're traveling with a group, Airbnbs can help you stay together in a place with a shared kitchen and living spaces.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf something like that is more your speed, then use both Vrbo and Airbnb to start your search. Both websites operate similarly and can be searched with a long list of filters and using the map.\\nVacation rental websites like these are a great way to find a special, unique stay as well. Want something with a little bit of charm instead of a sterile hotel room? Live in someone's home!\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFinding the best hotel booking site and the sweetest hotel deals doesn't have to be stressful. A single best website to book hotels doesn't truly exist, but there are tons of great accommodation booking sites that could lead you right to the perfect place to stay on your next trip.\\nThe best hotel deals can be found at any of these 17 hotel reservation websites… plus a few more!

It’s either that or outside in a hammock. But never at a hotel…\\nThat’s where you’re wrong! Cheap hotel chains in the USA are plentiful. Better than that though, they’re cheap!\\nThe best budget hotels chains in the US are truly excellent pieces of accommodation and not to be overlooked. They offer a fantastic alternative to the classic choices of budget stays for domestic travellers in America. Instead of staying somewhere completely derelict or somewhere fiendishly expensive (or somewhere in the woods), you can get yourself a cheap sleep and a hot shower somewhere comfy!\\nHowever, we’ve all heard the sordid stories of America’s cheapest hotels and motels. Hushed whispers in dank corridors of “hard, feculent motel pillows”…\\nNot all the cheap hotel chains in the USA are going to be somewhere you want to spend a night. Some are just downright putrid! Others are simply intended for the more questionable activities of the night.\\nNever fear though—you have this guide: a comprehensive comparison of the best budget hotel chains in the USA. I’ve done the hard work researching which cheap hotel chains are really deserving of your cash. We have winners, runner-ups, honourable mentions, and everything in between, so let’s get this show on the road!\\nWe’ll leave no feculent motel pillow unturned in our search for the ULTIMATE marshmallow mattress… at a reasonable price.\\nThe Broke Backpacker is supported by you. Clicking through our links may earn us a small affiliate commission, and that's what allows us to keep producing free content 🙂 Learn more.\\nWe’re now running through the top picks of America’s most affordable hotel chains. Despite what you may have heard, not all cheap hotels in the USA are dens of debauchery and decay.\\nNay, these babies are sparkly clean and lined with the amenities to keep a smile on any soulful bachelor’s face! Standards are high and renovations and refurbishments are surprisingly regular amongst most of these listings.\\nWhile all these chains top out customer satisfaction surveys on the regular, it’s really unfair to call any ‘the best’. They all do something different, they all do it well, and they’re all worthy of a booking for it!\\nSo in the order of most awesome to equally most awesome—with a little something for every frugal holidayer and tight-assed traveller exploring the US on a budget—here are the best budget hotel chains in the USA.\\nPop your email in below to get a FREE copy of ‘How to Travel the World on $10 a Day!’.\\n\\nΔ\\n\\nAnyone who’s spent some time on America’s byways and highways has encountered a Motel 6 at this point (they are ubiquitous in American motel culture). You could call it a discount hotel chain, you could could it a budget motel chain, but the point is that they’re cheap and they have plenty of beds!\\nWhat they don’t have is any extra platitudes. Free WiFi and brekky are simply not gonna be a thing most of the time (although free coffee in the morning IS a thing and ALWAYS appreciated).\\nSo if Motel 6 is lacking in bells and whistles, what’s the point? I mean, I really can’t reiterate enough just how cheap these guys are.\\xa0\\nRelative to the other options on this list (and across America), you won’t find much cheaper—they’re easily one of the best budget hotel chains in the USA for travellers strictly looking for budget. They also allow up to two pets per room at no extra cost which is honestly quite impressive and gracious.\\xa0\\nCurrently, Motel 6 is in the process of refurbishing its 1200+ properties across numerous the USA’s famous and lesser-famous destinations. Watch the space because while the prices aren’t going up, the living standards are!\\nA supremely basic and cheap place to stay right on the doorstep of the Grand Canyon National Park! There's free parking for the road trippers, free coffee for the brew hounds, and an indoor pool for everybody else.\\n\\nAhh, Microtel… Microtel makes the cut for most budget hotel brand roundups and with good reason—they rock!\\nNow, as far as budget hotel chains go, they aren’t strictly the cheapest, but that’s also kinda the point. The rooms are smaller, but they’re also more luxurious. They aren’t the cheapest, but they also aren’t the most expensive…\\nIt’s the sweet, majestic middleman.\\nOwned by the Wyndham Hotel Group (a name you’re going to see repeated on this more than once), Microtel Inn & Suites has always been a top contender of the best economy hotel chains in America, however, since their acquisition by Wyndham, they’ve only become more consistent!\\nIf you’re looking for the true no-frills experience, look elsewhere. Microtel’s rooms may be a touch… micro… but they’re also decked with a lotta nice trimmings. They’re the perfect choice for anyone looking to live cheaply and with some privacy but a touch above the true budget traveller lifestyle.\\nGet a cheap yet blissful night's sleep in the mountainous resort city of Pigeon Forge! Only 15 minutes drive from the Smoky Mountains National Park, spend your days exploring the region (after a free breakfast) before returning for a dip in the outdoor pool. It's the perfect balance of luxury to budget-friendly!\\n\\nWyndham is at it again with another kickass economy hotel chain! With nearly 100 years of history behind it, the Travelodge hotel chain has been taking care of frugal travellers’ needs for a long-long while.\\nTravelodge accommodations tend to be very well located. There are even a number of Travelodges neatly situated around some of the USA’s most famous national parks making it perfect for anyone on a tour of the Great American Wilderness.\\nGenerally speaking, right around the board, they offer mint rooms for the price of entry. King-size beds, workspaces, full-power showers, and, yes, internet connectivity. Sometimes there are charging ports by the bed, blackout curtains, LED lighting, and other finishing touches that make you go “Ooh, that’s nice.”\\nThe long and short of it—they’re just one of the best economy hotel chains in the US. A solid all-rounder from start to finish. AND (for the cherry on top), every location has an on-site bar.\\nCheers to that!\\nOne of the cheapest places to stay close to Yellowstone National Park—only 25 minutes drive from Mammoth Hot Springs! Rooms are surprisingly spacious (particularly if you nab one with a kitchenette), and the mountain views just tie the package together perfectly.\\nWant to save money on accommodation?\\nEnjoy 15% OFF on stays ALL around the world.\\n\\nWyndham you sneaky devils. The aces up your sleeve just keep coming!\\nSuper 8 is Wyndham’s ultra-budget answer to Motel 6. The prices are still low, albeit a touch higher than Motel 6’s, but you get wayyy more bang for your buck. WiFi is included, as is the continental breakfast, and the rooms are generally splashier than Motel 6.\\nPrices have crept a bit higher over the last few years, but that seems to be reflective of the constant renovations taking place at many of Super 8’s locations across the USA. Overall, Super 8 isn’t the cheapest hotel chain in America, but it’s far from expensive and offers a lot for what you pay.\\nThe choice between a Motel 6 or a Super 8 really just comes down to your budget and how much you like the extra creature comforts… and WiFi. It’s all about that WiFi.\\nPool, breakfast, nice rooms… these things are all great, however, how about an on-site casino right inside the hotel! Still not tickling your fancies? Then maybe the on-site pizza and sub shop inside the casino will do the trick!\\n\\nOver a short 13-year span, this budget friendly hotel chain has grown from a meagre 2 listings to a whopping 1000+ opulent locales at a fair price! In fact, prior to Microtel’s acquisition by Wyndham (and subsequent refinement), America’s Best Value Inn was topping most customer surveys on the best value hotel chains in the US.\\nFree breakfast, WiFi, and parking are standard at most of their locations, and the internet is cracking fast. That—combined with the in-house meeting rooms throughout their constantly expanding network—make it a favourite with the travelling business sorts.\\nGiven how quickly this hotel chain has both expanded AND shot up through the ranks of customer satisfaction, you definitely won’t go wrong booking a budget stay in one of their esteemed guestrooms. They’ve even got a pool to take a dip in before you head to your room for that steamy evening shower!\\nIt's probably not necessarily the nicest America's Best Value Inn, however, being only a 10-minute walk from Disneyland, who's to complain? The guest rooms have got a few extra trimmings to make this an extra sweet deal, and there are even discount tickets for Disneyland available at reception!\\nIf you’re deciding where to stay in Anaheim, this inn is great value – especially considering it’s proximity to the infamous Disneyland!\\n\\nSo, Candlewood Suites is broaching into midscale territory, however, I’m such a fan of what they’re about that I just have to mention them. Candlewood Suites is the best inexpensive hotel chain for long-stayers!\\nEach suite comes with a fully-equipped kitchen decked out and ready for cooking some cost-effective meals from the comfort of your room. With choices between studios and one-bedroom rooms for solo travellers or the larger suites for families and couples, there really is something for everyone at Candlewood Suites.\\nMost locations have parking, including truck parking for the roadwarriors (meaning those planning an RV trip will find themselves some spacious spots too). Plus (if you are doing those longe interstate drives), you’ll find a pool at most Candlewood Suites locations for a dip at the end of the day.\\nOR, for one better, a hot tub! Now that’s something most cheap hotels in America certainly do not offer!\\nDude, you're five minutes from Times Square smack bang right in the heart of Manhattan. There's an on-site fitness centre AND business centre (plus the rooms are certainly flash), however, just taking a healthy and scrumptious bite of the Big Apple life is more than enough reason to book this hotel!\\n\\nHoliday Inn Express is not exactly cheap, but it’s still oen of the most affordable hotel chains in the USA. It’s a great choice for travellers who have a bit more money to spend but still want to keep the trip budget friendly.\\nRooms are relatively small, making this chain particularly great for business travellers who won’t be in their rooms often. Each room is well designed with modern furniture, free wifi, coffee and tea.\\nYou can also expect free breakfast – which is much-loved by guests and goes above and beyond your typical hotel buffet.\\nWith thousands of properties across the States AND the world, you’ll find a wide variety of amenities from outdoor pools to fitness centers and room service. Plus, it’s super safe – you won’t get any seedy motel vibes here!\\nThere's a colourful pool deck, a delicious and convenient buffet breakfast… plus we can't forget the obvious: YOU'RE IN HAWAII! You'll get to enjoy spacious rooms (some of which have an ocean view), and remain firmly within walking distance from just about everything Honolulu has to offer. While its not as cheap as other Holiday Inn Express locations, it is a remote island chain after all.\\n\\nLook for the trademark red roof and chances are you’ve found a Red Roof Inn! Despite having over 500 locations across the States, they are still one of the lesser-widespread cheap hotel chains in America. So what makes them worth the booking?\\nWell, free brekky and WiFi at most of their establishments certainly ain’t bad! Rooms generally are equipped with workspaces (along with the aforementioned free WiFi) making it a good choice for people working on the road.\\nAnd speaking of the road, Red Roof Inn accommodations are an excellent choice of a hotel chain for road trips across the USA. They’re cheap, they offer a decent night’s sleep following a long day’s drive, and best of all…\\nThey allow pets! Well, pet. One pet per room. You won’t exactly be able to start a menagerie in your budget hotel room, but at least you’ll have a friend!\\nRed Roof Inns are now also offering Red Roof Plus rooms—$15 extra a night scores you a bit more luxury in your lap. Perhaps it’s not totally worth the extra dollars, however, you can’t deny the rooms look mighty sleek.\\nOnly a short way from the airport is this cheap stay and springboard for exploring Florida state. It's a clean but basic place to stay, but the cheap price, central location, and on-site gym kick it up a notch. Besides, score yourself a room with a hot tub and you'll be living the high-flier's lifestyle on a low-flier's wage!\\nWanna know how to pack like a pro? Well for a start you need the right gear….\\nThese are packing cubes for the globetrotters and compression sacks for the\\xa0real adventurers – these babies are a traveller’s best kept secret. They organise yo’ packing and minimise volume too so you can pack MORE.\\nOr, y’know… you can stick to just chucking it all in your backpack…\\nDriving the West Coast, East Coast, or all the way to Argentina—doesn’t matter! The laws of booking a cheap hotel are pretty universal.\\nPlan well, book far in advance, and reward points are your friend.\\nBooking.com. I mean there are plenty of other excellent sites for booking hotels, however, nine times out of ten, you’ll probably end up booking through Booking.com.\\nBooking.com has an incredible range of places to stay and, in particular, types of places to stay. It’s not just hotels—apartments, guest houses, homestays, treehouses, geodesic wonder-domes… There’s something for every holiday!\\nThey get solid discounts on the regular too, both for last-minute scores or for rabid itinerary planners who like to book early. They’re not perfect—the interface behaves like a bit of a wiener and they really have a lockdown on the lion’s share of the market (which is never really a good thing).\\nHowever, most times when scouring for cheap chain hotels, chances are it’ll end up being through Booking.com. They’re the gold standard for a reason.\\nPast that, there are a few other mentions to keep in mind. Though most budget hotels can be found on Booking.com, savvy consumers don’t put all their eggs in one basket—you gotta spread that love around! You never know when a different hotel booking platform is going to have the same (or similar) budget hotel at a smidgen cheaper.\\nOther baskets to put your love into include:\\nA long, long time ago, I had a whole stockpile of reward points for a major supermarket chain banked up. Then, breakups happened; my ex whisked herself off with all my waiting freebies just before the Christmas shopping season. Now, I don’t know what she did with those points, but whatever it was, I can guarantee it was black-hearted and evil!\\nWhat’s the moral of the story? Bitchez be cray! Use your reward points!\\nA staple of America’s thriving motel scene, you can save a lot on most of the best hotel chains in the USA with their in-house loyalty programs. (And the cheap hotel chains are just the same!) Book enough nights or often enough and soon you’ll find yourself the proud recipient of a free night stay.\\nMost budget hotel chains have some sort of rewards system, and they tend to be pretty easy to sign up for. Usually, a quick Google or chat at the reception will get the job done.\\nFor the hotel chains that we’ve covered in this article…\\nLastly, if you’re a total point scrounger, then investing in a credit card that stacks up the reward points is a smart idea too. Both the Capital One Venture Rewards Card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card can earn you some seriously sexy savings on a whole bunch of travel-related things  (including accommodation booking or even flights).\\nIf you’re really looking for the cheapest stays across America’s hotel chains, it’s all about them points.\\nSee—it’s not all wicked dens of heathenry and unwashed linens! There are plenty of stellar budget hotel chains in the USA that makes travelling the States affordable–there are even a few we didn’t mention like Best Western, Days Inn, Sleep Inn, and the Hampton Inn. Yes, the USA does love its Inns!\\nCompetition is fierce in the market, and that breeds higher standards. The more our favourite budget hotel brands renovate and refurbish, the nicer things become. Prices may creep higher, however, cheap is still the goal (and usually the reality).\\nIn a world of Airbnb and the sharing economy, hotels are finding themself less-and-less the star of holidayers’ dream getaways. Similarly, sites like Booking.com and Agoda are branching out from hotels and increasingly pitching themselves as an alternative to Airbnb (among the growing market of sites doing things like Airbnb).\\nStill, there will always be a place for the humble budget hotel chain amongst the deserts, rivers, and mountains of the American landscape. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of driving 8+ hours across the wastes only to sight that motel signage heralding a cheerful night’s rest on a hard, feculent pillow.\\nAnd until we’re paying hourly rates at motels for whatever your—ahem—‘needs’ might be (thank you, Colombia, for this winning innovation), that’ll do just fine.\\nA couple of you lovely readers suggested we set up a tip jar for direct support as an alternative to booking through our links. So we created one!\\nYou can now buy The Broke Backpacker a coffee.

But “quick\" doesn\\'t necessarily mean cheap—the cost of a three-day weekend for a family of four can quickly add up, whether you\\'re headed to the beach, the mountains, or the city.\\nBelow, we\\'ll take a look at the average cost of a three-day getaway for a family of four in the northeast United States. Feeling sticker shock? Fear not: We\\'ll share a variety of options to help you save money on your next weekend trip.\\n\\nLodging\\nAccommodations can rapidly eat up any travel budget. But if you\\'re flexible, this is also an area where you can find savings.\\nThe average daily hotel rate in the U.S. is about $180, or $540 for three nights. But rates vary depending on where you\\'re headed and when you\\'re traveling. Hotel rooms in a major city, during summertime peaks or over a holiday weekend will likely command higher prices.\\nThinking about booking an Airbnb in the northeast? Average prices per night hover around $200, or $600 for three nights, according to data from AllTheRooms:\\n\\nPennsylvania: $192\\nDelaware - $256\\nMaryland: $186\\nVirginia: $181\\nNew Jersey: $195\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re happy to forego creature comforts, tent camping at a state park is a fraction of the price of a hotel or vacation rental. Starting at $16 a night for in-state residents; you’ll pay a little more if you’re traveling out of state or during a weekend or holiday. \\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Consider the getaway you want as you compare options. If you simply need a place to sleep during a weekend of big-city tourism, a hotel may be more affordable than an Airbnb. If you prefer to cook your own meals and kick back at your home base, an Airbnb might be the cheaper choice.\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nAir travel is the most expensive way to get from point A to point B, costing around $406 per person for domestic flights out of Philadelphia and $352 out of Baltimore—that\\'s $1,625 and $1,408, respectively, for a family of four.\\n\\nDriving is the cheapest way to travel: If the average gas price per gallon is $3.80 and you embark on a 400-mile round trip, you’re looking at $52 in gas to transport the whole family (assuming 29 miles to the gallon).  Calculate your own gas estimate  and review average gas prices by state before you travel to get an idea of what to budget.\\n\\nAnother option: Rail travel. The average Amtrak fare sits around $72 per person, or $288 for a family of four. While that\\'s pricier than driving, it\\'s a bargain compared to flying.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Drive to your destination if you want to avoid purchasing costly flights for the whole family. If you\\'re open to spending a little more, traveling by train also provides a unique way to see the country and enjoy the journey to your destination—plus, you avoid pulling over for bathroom breaks and the inevitable impulse snack purchase.\\n\\nFood\\n\\nHow much will you spend on food during a three-day vacation? That depends on whether you have an appetite for fine dining or you prefer grab-and-go meals from the grocery store.\\n\\nSome estimates place the average daily meal cost around $104 for a single person, that’s $417 for a family of four and just over $1200 for three days. But that assumes you\\'re dining out for every meal.\\n\\nMoney-saving tip: If you can\\'t stomach the thought of spending over $1,000 to eat for three days, there are endless ways to save money on food while you travel: Stay at a hotel with a continental breakfast, for instance, or pack your own snacks and water bottles.\\n\\nActivities\\nA day at the museum can cost anywhere from $0 to over $100 for a family of four. Art museum tickets range from free to nearly $30 apiece at museums across the U.S.\\n\\nBut there are ways to save on cultural attractions, including museums. Take advantage of free admission days to get the whole family in at no cost. Some attractions allow kids to visit for free, and others offer student discounts for young visitors. Beyond museums, prices vary for local attractions. \\nMoney-saving tip: You might find discounts on attractions during the off season or at quiet times of day: Hershey Park offers discounted “happy hour\" tickets after 4 p.m., for example.\\xa0\\n\\nSave or splurge: The choice is yours\\nA three-day weekend can be as affordable or ritzy as your budget allows. If your goal is to save money, do your research to find the right accommodations, transportation options, and activities for both your family and your wallet.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLabor Day weekend may have you dreaming about taking a quick getaway with the family. But “quick\" doesn\\'t necessarily mean cheap—the cost of a three-day weekend for a family of four can quickly add up, whether you\\'re headed to the beach, the mountains, or the city.\\nBelow, we\\'ll take a look at the average cost of a three-day getaway for a family of four in the northeast United States. Feeling sticker shock? Fear not: We\\'ll share a variety of options to help you save money on your next weekend trip.\\nAccommodations can rapidly eat up any travel budget. But if you\\'re flexible, this is also an area where you can find savings.\\nThe average daily hotel rate in the U.S. is about $180, or $540 for three nights. But rates vary depending on where you\\'re headed and when you\\'re traveling. Hotel rooms in a major city, during summertime peaks or over a holiday weekend will likely command higher prices.\\nThinking about booking an Airbnb in the northeast? Average prices per night hover around $200, or $600 for three nights, according to data from AllTheRooms:\\n\\nIf you\\'re happy to forego creature comforts, tent camping at a state park is a fraction of the price of a hotel or vacation rental. Starting at $16 a night for in-state residents; you’ll pay a little more if you’re traveling out of state or during a weekend or holiday. \\n\\nMoney-saving tip: Consider the getaway you want as you compare options.

A professional journalist, he joined the comp...\\n    \\nHere at Thrifty Traveler, we're all about cheap flights. But traveling on the cheap goes beyond airfare: Hotel costs can add up even faster. Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons. For one, they can be a saving grace when hotel rates are too high. Often, you can find better value booking an entire apartment than you can booking a tiny hotel room.\\xa0Plus, if you're traveling with a group, Airbnbs can help you stay together in a place with a shared kitchen and living spaces.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf something like that is more your speed, then use both Vrbo and Airbnb to start your search. Both websites operate similarly and can be searched with a long list of filters and using the map.\\nVacation rental websites like these are a great way to find a special, unique stay as well. Want something with a little bit of charm instead of a sterile hotel room? Live in someone's home!\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFinding the best hotel booking site and the sweetest hotel deals doesn't have to be stressful.

It’s either that or outside in a hammock. But never at a hotel…\\nThat’s where you’re wrong! Cheap hotel chains in the USA are plentiful. Better than that though, they’re cheap!\\nThe best budget hotels chains in the US are truly excellent pieces of accommodation and not to be overlooked. They offer a fantastic alternative to the classic choices of budget stays for domestic travellers in America. Instead of staying somewhere completely derelict or somewhere fiendishly expensive (or somewhere in the woods), you can get yourself a cheap sleep and a hot shower somewhere comfy!\\nHowever, we’ve all heard the sordid stories of America’s cheapest hotels and motels. Hushed whispers in dank corridors of “hard, feculent motel pillows”…\\nNot all the cheap hotel chains in the USA are going to be somewhere you want to spend a night. Some are just downright putrid! Others are simply intended for the more questionable activities of the night.\\nNever fear though—you have this guide: a comprehensive comparison of the best budget hotel chains in the USA. I’ve done the hard work researching which cheap hotel chains are really deserving of your cash. We have winners, runner-ups, honourable mentions, and everything in between, so let’s get this show on the road!\\nWe’ll leave no feculent motel pillow unturned in our search for the ULTIMATE marshmallow mattress… at a reasonable price.\\nThe Broke Backpacker is supported by you. Clicking through our links may earn us a small affiliate commission, and that's what allows us to keep producing free content 🙂 Learn more.\\nWe’re now running through the top picks of America’s most affordable hotel chains. Despite what you may have heard, not all cheap hotels in the USA are dens of debauchery and decay.\\nNay, these babies are sparkly clean and lined with the amenities to keep a smile on any soulful bachelor’s face! Standards are high and renovations and refurbishments are surprisingly regular amongst most of these listings.\\nWhile all these chains top out customer satisfaction surveys on the regular, it’s really unfair to call any ‘the best’. They all do something different, they all do it well, and they’re all worthy of a booking for it!\\nSo in the order of most awesome to equally most awesome—with a little something for every frugal holidayer and tight-assed traveller exploring the US on a budget—here are the best budget hotel chains in the USA.\\nPop your email in below to get a FREE copy of ‘How to Travel the World on $10 a Day!’.\\n\\nΔ\\n\\nAnyone who’s spent some time on America’s byways and highways has encountered a Motel 6 at this point (they are ubiquitous in American motel culture). You could call it a discount hotel chain, you could could it a budget motel chain, but the point is that they’re cheap and they have plenty of beds!\\nWhat they don’t have is any extra platitudes. Free WiFi and brekky are simply not gonna be a thing most of the time (although free coffee in the morning IS a thing and ALWAYS appreciated).\\nSo if Motel 6 is lacking in bells and whistles, what’s the point? I mean, I really can’t reiterate enough just how cheap these guys are.\\xa0\\nRelative to the other options on this list (and across America), you won’t find much cheaper—they’re easily one of the best budget hotel chains in the USA for travellers strictly looking for budget. They also allow up to two pets per room at no extra cost which is honestly quite impressive and gracious.\\xa0\\nCurrently, Motel 6 is in the process of refurbishing its 1200+ properties across numerous the USA’s famous and lesser-famous destinations. Watch the space because while the prices aren’t going up, the living standards are!\\nA supremely basic and cheap place to stay right on the doorstep of the Grand Canyon National Park! There's free parking for the road trippers, free coffee for the brew hounds, and an indoor pool for everybody else.\\n\\nAhh, Microtel… Microtel makes the cut for most budget hotel brand roundups and with good reason—they rock!\\nNow, as far as budget hotel chains go, they aren’t strictly the cheapest, but that’s also kinda the point. The rooms are smaller, but they’re also more luxurious. They aren’t the cheapest, but they also aren’t the most expensive…\\nIt’s the sweet, majestic middleman.\\nOwned by the Wyndham Hotel Group (a name you’re going to see repeated on this more than once), Microtel Inn & Suites has always been a top contender of the best economy hotel chains in America, however, since their acquisition by Wyndham, they’ve only become more consistent!\\nIf you’re looking for the true no-frills experience, look elsewhere. Microtel’s rooms may be a touch… micro… but they’re also decked with a lotta nice trimmings. They’re the perfect choice for anyone looking to live cheaply and with some privacy but a touch above the true budget traveller lifestyle.\\nGet a cheap yet blissful night's sleep in the mountainous resort city of Pigeon Forge! Only 15 minutes drive from the Smoky Mountains National Park, spend your days exploring the region (after a free breakfast) before returning for a dip in the outdoor pool. It's the perfect balance of luxury to budget-friendly!\\n\\nWyndham is at it again with another kickass economy hotel chain! With nearly 100 years of history behind it, the Travelodge hotel chain has been taking care of frugal travellers’ needs for a long-long while.\\nTravelodge accommodations tend to be very well located. There are even a number of Travelodges neatly situated around some of the USA’s most famous national parks making it perfect for anyone on a tour of the Great American Wilderness.\\nGenerally speaking, right around the board, they offer mint rooms for the price of entry. King-size beds, workspaces, full-power showers, and, yes, internet connectivity. Sometimes there are charging ports by the bed, blackout curtains, LED lighting, and other finishing touches that make you go “Ooh, that’s nice.”\\nThe long and short of it—they’re just one of the best economy hotel chains in the US. A solid all-rounder from start to finish. AND (for the cherry on top), every location has an on-site bar.\\nCheers to that!\\nOne of the cheapest places to stay close to Yellowstone National Park—only 25 minutes drive from Mammoth Hot Springs! Rooms are surprisingly spacious (particularly if you nab one with a kitchenette), and the mountain views just tie the package together perfectly.\\nWant to save money on accommodation?\\nEnjoy 15% OFF on stays ALL around the world.\\n\\nWyndham you sneaky devils. The aces up your sleeve just keep coming!\\nSuper 8 is Wyndham’s ultra-budget answer to Motel 6. The prices are still low, albeit a touch higher than Motel 6’s, but you get wayyy more bang for your buck. WiFi is included, as is the continental breakfast, and the rooms are generally splashier than Motel 6.\\nPrices have crept a bit higher over the last few years, but that seems to be reflective of the constant renovations taking place at many of Super 8’s locations across the USA. Overall, Super 8 isn’t the cheapest hotel chain in America, but it’s far from expensive and offers a lot for what you pay.\\nThe choice between a Motel 6 or a Super 8 really just comes down to your budget and how much you like the extra creature comforts… and WiFi. It’s all about that WiFi.\\nPool, breakfast, nice rooms… these things are all great, however, how about an on-site casino right inside the hotel! Still not tickling your fancies? Then maybe the on-site pizza and sub shop inside the casino will do the trick!\\n\\nOver a short 13-year span, this budget friendly hotel chain has grown from a meagre 2 listings to a whopping 1000+ opulent locales at a fair price! In fact, prior to Microtel’s acquisition by Wyndham (and subsequent refinement), America’s Best Value Inn was topping most customer surveys on the best value hotel chains in the US.\\nFree breakfast, WiFi, and parking are standard at most of their locations, and the internet is cracking fast. That—combined with the in-house meeting rooms throughout their constantly expanding network—make it a favourite with the travelling business sorts.\\nGiven how quickly this hotel chain has both expanded AND shot up through the ranks of customer satisfaction, you definitely won’t go wrong booking a budget stay in one of their esteemed guestrooms. They’ve even got a pool to take a dip in before you head to your room for that steamy evening shower!\\nIt's probably not necessarily the nicest America's Best Value Inn, however, being only a 10-minute walk from Disneyland, who's to complain? The guest rooms have got a few extra trimmings to make this an extra sweet deal, and there are even discount tickets for Disneyland available at reception!\\nIf you’re deciding where to stay in Anaheim, this inn is great value – especially considering it’s proximity to the infamous Disneyland!\\n\\nSo, Candlewood Suites is broaching into midscale territory, however, I’m such a fan of what they’re about that I just have to mention them. Candlewood Suites is the best inexpensive hotel chain for long-stayers!\\nEach suite comes with a fully-equipped kitchen decked out and ready for cooking some cost-effective meals from the comfort of your room. With choices between studios and one-bedroom rooms for solo travellers or the larger suites for families and couples, there really is something for everyone at Candlewood Suites.\\nMost locations have parking, including truck parking for the roadwarriors (meaning those planning an RV trip will find themselves some spacious spots too). Plus (if you are doing those longe interstate drives), you’ll find a pool at most Candlewood Suites locations for a dip at the end of the day.\\nOR, for one better, a hot tub! Now that’s something most cheap hotels in America certainly do not offer!\\nDude, you're five minutes from Times Square smack bang right in the heart of Manhattan. There's an on-site fitness centre AND business centre (plus the rooms are certainly flash), however, just taking a healthy and scrumptious bite of the Big Apple life is more than enough reason to book this hotel!\\n\\nHoliday Inn Express is not exactly cheap, but it’s still oen of the most affordable hotel chains in the USA. It’s a great choice for travellers who have a bit more money to spend but still want to keep the trip budget friendly.\\nRooms are relatively small, making this chain particularly great for business travellers who won’t be in their rooms often. Each room is well designed with modern furniture, free wifi, coffee and tea.\\nYou can also expect free breakfast – which is much-loved by guests and goes above and beyond your typical hotel buffet.\\nWith thousands of properties across the States AND the world, you’ll find a wide variety of amenities from outdoor pools to fitness centers and room service. Plus, it’s super safe – you won’t get any seedy motel vibes here!\\nThere's a colourful pool deck, a delicious and convenient buffet breakfast… plus we can't forget the obvious: YOU'RE IN HAWAII! You'll get to enjoy spacious rooms (some of which have an ocean view), and remain firmly within walking distance from just about everything Honolulu has to offer. While its not as cheap as other Holiday Inn Express locations, it is a remote island chain after all.\\n\\nLook for the trademark red roof and chances are you’ve found a Red Roof Inn! Despite having over 500 locations across the States, they are still one of the lesser-widespread cheap hotel chains in America. So what makes them worth the booking?\\nWell, free brekky and WiFi at most of their establishments certainly ain’t bad! Rooms generally are equipped with workspaces (along with the aforementioned free WiFi) making it a good choice for people working on the road.\\nAnd speaking of the road, Red Roof Inn accommodations are an excellent choice of a hotel chain for road trips across the USA. They’re cheap, they offer a decent night’s sleep following a long day’s drive, and best of all…\\nThey allow pets! Well, pet. One pet per room. You won’t exactly be able to start a menagerie in your budget hotel room, but at least you’ll have a friend!\\nRed Roof Inns are now also offering Red Roof Plus rooms—$15 extra a night scores you a bit more luxury in your lap. Perhaps it’s not totally worth the extra dollars, however, you can’t deny the rooms look mighty sleek.\\nOnly a short way from the airport is this cheap stay and springboard for exploring Florida state. It's a clean but basic place to stay, but the cheap price, central location, and on-site gym kick it up a notch. Besides, score yourself a room with a hot tub and you'll be living the high-flier's lifestyle on a low-flier's wage!\\nWanna know how to pack like a pro? Well for a start you need the right gear….\\nThese are packing cubes for the globetrotters and compression sacks for the\\xa0real adventurers – these babies are a traveller’s best kept secret. They organise yo’ packing and minimise volume too so you can pack MORE.\\nOr, y’know… you can stick to just chucking it all in your backpack…\\nDriving the West Coast, East Coast, or all the way to Argentina—doesn’t matter! The laws of booking a cheap hotel are pretty universal.\\nPlan well, book far in advance, and reward points are your friend.\\nBooking.com. I mean there are plenty of other excellent sites for booking hotels, however, nine times out of ten, you’ll probably end up booking through Booking.com.\\nBooking.com has an incredible range of places to stay and, in particular, types of places to stay. It’s not just hotels—apartments, guest houses, homestays, treehouses, geodesic wonder-domes… There’s something for every holiday!\\nThey get solid discounts on the regular too, both for last-minute scores or for rabid itinerary planners who like to book early. They’re not perfect—the interface behaves like a bit of a wiener and they really have a lockdown on the lion’s share of the market (which is never really a good thing).\\nHowever, most times when scouring for cheap chain hotels, chances are it’ll end up being through Booking.com. They’re the gold standard for a reason.\\nPast that, there are a few other mentions to keep in mind. Though most budget hotels can be found on Booking.com, savvy consumers don’t put all their eggs in one basket—you gotta spread that love around! You never know when a different hotel booking platform is going to have the same (or similar) budget hotel at a smidgen cheaper.\\nOther baskets to put your love into include:\\nA long, long time ago, I had a whole stockpile of reward points for a major supermarket chain banked up. Then, breakups happened; my ex whisked herself off with all my waiting freebies just before the Christmas shopping season. Now, I don’t know what she did with those points, but whatever it was, I can guarantee it was black-hearted and evil!\\nWhat’s the moral of the story? Bitchez be cray! Use your reward points!\\nA staple of America’s thriving motel scene, you can save a lot on most of the best hotel chains in the USA with their in-house loyalty programs. (And the cheap hotel chains are just the same!) Book enough nights or often enough and soon you’ll find yourself the proud recipient of a free night stay.\\nMost budget hotel chains have some sort of rewards system, and they tend to be pretty easy to sign up for. Usually, a quick Google or chat at the reception will get the job done.\\nFor the hotel chains that we’ve covered in this article…\\nLastly, if you’re a total point scrounger, then investing in a credit card that stacks up the reward points is a smart idea too. Both the Capital One Venture Rewards Card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card can earn you some seriously sexy savings on a whole bunch of travel-related things  (including accommodation booking or even flights).\\nIf you’re really looking for the cheapest stays across America’s hotel chains, it’s all about them points.\\nSee—it’s not all wicked dens of heathenry and unwashed linens! There are plenty of stellar budget hotel chains in the USA that makes travelling the States affordable–there are even a few we didn’t mention like Best Western, Days Inn, Sleep Inn, and the Hampton Inn. Yes, the USA does love its Inns!\\nCompetition is fierce in the market, and that breeds higher standards. The more our favourite budget hotel brands renovate and refurbish, the nicer things become. Prices may creep higher, however, cheap is still the goal (and usually the reality).\\nIn a world of Airbnb and the sharing economy, hotels are finding themself less-and-less the star of holidayers’ dream getaways. Similarly, sites like Booking.com and Agoda are branching out from hotels and increasingly pitching themselves as an alternative to Airbnb (among the growing market of sites doing things like Airbnb).\\nStill, there will always be a place for the humble budget hotel chain amongst the deserts, rivers, and mountains of the American landscape. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of driving 8+ hours across the wastes only to sight that motel signage heralding a cheerful night’s rest on a hard, feculent pillow.\\nAnd until we’re paying hourly rates at motels for whatever your—ahem—‘needs’ might be (thank you, Colombia, for this winning innovation), that’ll do just fine.\\nA couple of you lovely readers suggested we set up a tip jar for direct support as an alternative to booking through our links. So we created one!\\nYou can now buy The Broke Backpacker a coffee.

A professional journalist, he joined the comp...\\n    \\nHere at Thrifty Traveler, we're all about cheap flights. But traveling on the cheap goes beyond airfare: Hotel costs can add up even faster. Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons. For one, they can be a saving grace when hotel rates are too high. Often, you can find better value booking an entire apartment than you can booking a tiny hotel room.\\xa0Plus, if you're traveling with a group, Airbnbs can help you stay together in a place with a shared kitchen and living spaces.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf something like that is more your speed, then use both Vrbo and Airbnb to start your search. Both websites operate similarly and can be searched with a long list of filters and using the map.\\nVacation rental websites like these are a great way to find a special, unique stay as well. Want something with a little bit of charm instead of a sterile hotel room? Live in someone's home!\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFinding the best hotel booking site and the sweetest hotel deals doesn't have to be stressful. A single best website to book hotels doesn't truly exist, but there are tons of great accommodation booking sites that could lead you right to the perfect place to stay on your next trip.\\nThe best hotel deals can be found at any of these 17 hotel reservation websites… plus a few more!

Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal.

A professional journalist, he joined the comp...\\n    \\nHere at Thrifty Traveler, we're all about cheap flights. But traveling on the cheap goes beyond airfare: Hotel costs can add up even faster. Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons.

A professional journalist, he joined the comp...\\n    \\nHere at Thrifty Traveler, we're all about cheap flights. But traveling on the cheap goes beyond airfare: Hotel costs can add up even faster. Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons. For one, they can be a saving grace when hotel rates are too high. Often, you can find better value booking an entire apartment than you can booking a tiny hotel room.\\xa0Plus, if you're traveling with a group, Airbnbs can help you stay together in a place with a shared kitchen and living spaces.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf something like that is more your speed, then use both Vrbo and Airbnb to start your search. Both websites operate similarly and can be searched with a long list of filters and using the map.\\nVacation rental websites like these are a great way to find a special, unique stay as well. Want something with a little bit of charm instead of a sterile hotel room? Live in someone's home!\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFinding the best hotel booking site and the sweetest hotel deals doesn't have to be stressful. A single best website to book hotels doesn't truly exist, but there are tons of great accommodation booking sites that could lead you right to the perfect place to stay on your next trip.\\nThe best hotel deals can be found at any of these 17 hotel reservation websites… plus a few more!

A professional journalist, he joined the comp...\\n    \\nHere at Thrifty Traveler, we're all about cheap flights. But traveling on the cheap goes beyond airfare: Hotel costs can add up even faster. Finding a better deal on hotels starts with searching in the right place.\\nIn many ways, that can be even more frustrating than with flights. There are tons of websites, portals, and search aggregation tools, each offering the same property at different prices. “Should I be using my credit card booking site? Is booking directly with the hotel the best way? What about Airbnb and VRBO? Is Agoda legit?”\\nOur team has booked hotels all over the world using many different hotel booking sites over the years. Let's walk through some of the best options and help you determine which sites should be your go-to for your next trip.\\nWant the hotel deals to come to you – including top-rated properties bookable with points? Thrifty Traveler Premium members can now opt in for Hotel Alerts!\\n\\xa0\\nHotel websites come in all shapes and sizes.\\nFor starters, there are the sites from hotel chains themselves like Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, IHG, and others, bringing you hotel rates right from the hotels themselves. Then there are online travel agencies you may know (and maybe even love) like Expedia, Orbitz, or Hotwire, which lump together tons of hotel bookings and can offer big savings.\\nOther aggregators like Google Hotels bring you nearly every booking option – whether it's from the hotel itself or an online travel agency – all in one place so travelers can make the best choice (at the lowest price) from all of those options. And finally, there are credit card travel portals run by banks like Chase, American Express, and Capital One that allow you to book with their points – or earn more points on each stay.\\xa0\\nIt's a big, big world of hotel deals, so you need to find the site that is right for you.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you aren't booking directly with the hotel on sites like Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt, odds are you're searching through a third-party booking site. Those websites offer reservations for the very same hotels … but sometimes at different prices.\\nThese sites can be hit or miss. We always recommend comparing the cost of booking through one of these sites versus booking directly with the hotel.\\nFor flights, we urge travelers to book right with the airline – when things go wrong or if your plans change, it's much easier to get help through the airline than going through a middleman. There's less risk when booking hotels through another site … but there can still be drawbacks:\\nOn the flip side, these third-party booking sites might (but not always) offer you a much better deal than booking direct.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFrom the makers of the world's best flight search tool, Google Flights, Google Hotels similarly allows users to filter for the exact accommodations they want, exactly when they want them, while seeing nearly every booking option at their disposal.\\nGoogle Hotels is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily zero in on a hotel you want, then shows you all the different ways you can book .Google Hotels even allows you to search for either hotels or vacation rentals – it's one of the few that allows you to search for both.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nRead our full guide to using Google Hotels to find cheaper hotels!\\nIn this hotel search for Las Vegas in October, you can filter for hotel star rating, price, special offers, pools and other amenities, class, brands, and much more. You can even check the box for hotels that offer free cancellation, allow dogs, are wheelchair accessible, have beach access, or much, much more. Google recently added the ability to add hotels to a list of favorites, saving them as you weigh which property to pick!\\nOnce you've made your choice and are ready to book, you simply click “View prices”, which takes you to a page with tons of options for booking, whether that's directly with the hotel or through a third-party booking site.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Hotels is a great tool to find cheap hotel rooms, especially if you have specific requirements for your stay.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotels.com is another powerful hotel booking website that could help travelers really narrow down their options and find a nice nightly rate.\\nWhen it comes to a hotel booking site, they have possibly the simplest, most memorable name there is. As far as online travel agencies go, this one is easily our favorite on the (very long) list if you need a hotel stay.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helps set Hotels.com apart is its long list of filters that can get pretty specific to what you would want on vacation. You can filter for a room with a kitchen, how many bedrooms you want, what neighborhood you want to stay in, what landmarks you want to be near, if the place is LGBTQ welcoming, has hot tubs or ocean views, and much, much more.\\nUnfortunately, one of the best features of Hotels.com is no more. Its easy-to-use “Stay 10 nights, get one free” rewards program ended in 2023 after the platform merged its loyalty program with Expedia and other sites under the name One Key.\\xa0\\nJust watch for ads in your results: Some of the top results may not be there because they're the best, but because they're paying for top placement.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAgoda just might be the best hotel site you've never heard of.\\xa0\\nWhile it's not nearly as popular here in the U.S., it's a fan-favorite for hotel stays over in Asia – and it can be useful in many major destinations around the globe. In our experience, Agoda typically offers the lowest prices you'll see on any site on this list.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelers can filter by neighborhood, star rating, distance from city center, popular attractions, beach access, and more.\\nThe site also shows coupon code offers on the deals, occasionally offering sizable savings on hotel rooms. Plus, it shows how many choices there are within your search parameters. In one test case, the site said there were 347 Las Vegas hotels that fit the filters I selected for my sample booking in October.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire, on the other hand, is already incredibly popular. Its “Hot Rate” deals allow travelers to get even steeper discounts than you'll find on almost any other site, though it's a feature best utilized by travelers who aren't loyal to a specific hotel chain and are instead looking to save as much money as they can.\\nPlus, the website allows you to choose pre-arranged neighborhoods for your booking, so you can always end up in the spot you want.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the most interesting features of booking hotels with Hotwire is the “Hot Rate” feature, which hides the name of the resort from the user, instead offering the neighborhood, star rating, and all the amenities. By shielding the name of the resort, Hotwire offers some steep discounts on the rooms. Also, you can get a narrowed down list of possible hotels by clicking the “What hotel will I get?” button underneath the listing.\\nThrifty Tip: The website Better Bidding can help you narrow down even further to identify which mystery hotel you're booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotwire is also a great way to find rental cars and offers a way to book flights as well. The downside to Hotwire is a limited number of filters, meaning you'll have to use some trial and error if you have specific needs from your hotel or resort.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nAs far as online booking platforms go, Kayak is among the better options, in our minds.\\nMuch like Google Hotels, this is a powerful metasearch tool that lets you search and see prices through multiple booking sites at once, set price alerts, and filter down results to an unmatched level of specificity. You can search a map, find vacation rentals, and search through its list of “unique stays” as well. It's the most powerful hotel booking tool outside of Google Hotels – and it can occasionally offer even better deals.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne of the great features of Kayak as you search is that it offers a color-coded pricing calendar that allows you to see the dates where hotel rooms are cheaper than average, average, or higher than average. It can help you narrow down your search before you even see a listing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSo if you don't like the rates you're seeing on the dates you selected, you can always go back to this calendar view to find some cheaper ones. It could save you hundreds of dollars when booking.\\nOn the downside, Kayak's Explorer Rewards Program has extremely limited value – especially compared to the likes of Hotels.com. And like others on this list, you likely won't earn points or have any hotel loyalty recognized on your bookings (unless you wind up booking directly with the hotel after searching Kayak).\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, the best way to book your hotel stay is directly with the hotel chain. Hyatt and its World of Hyatt loyalty program is our favorite.\\nOnly World of Hyatt properties (and a handful of affiliated chains) are bookable on their website. By creating a free World of Hyatt loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nBut if you have any World of Hyatt points, you could find an incredible value. Nights at Hyatt properties start as low as 5,000 points per night – or even less during off-peak times!\\nRead our complete guide to the World of Hyatt program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, you can transfer Chase points from cards like the *chase sapphire preferred* to World of Hyatt if you aren't a regular Hyatt customer.\\nThe search filters aren't extensive, but there aren't very many Hyatt properties either, so you won't be overwhelmed with\\xa0 options.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHilton is another mega hotel chain where you can book hotel rooms directly on their website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHilton's site is easy to use with a relatively long list of search filters. By creating a free Hilton Honors account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates at all Hilton properties than non-members. Plus, you'll earn points on each stay.\\nYou can use Hilton Honors points to book rooms through the website, too. Hilton points can be earned or transferred from American Express and Bilt.\\nRead our complete guide to the Hilton Honors program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\nMarriott and its enormous list of world hotels can be booked directly through its website.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of this huge roster of participating hotels, Marriott Bonvoy has a ton of search filters for users to find the perfect hotel for their individual specifications.\\nAt Marriott's website, you can use both cash and Marriott points to book hotel stays. By creating a free Marriott Bonvoy loyalty account, you can often find slightly lower nightly rates than non-members.\\nMarriott points can be earned or transferred in from Chase and American Express.\\nRead our complete guide to the Marriott Bonvoy program, from free nights to credit cards and more!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline and its TV ad jingle are also probably known to many travelers. It's another great way to find deals on hotel bookings.\\nLike Hotwire's “Hot Rate” feature, Priceline's “Express Deals” hides the name of the hotel from the user until after booking in exchange for a much lower price. It's a nice feature for savings, but not the best for users who are brand loyal or are looking for a specific spot to stay on their journey.\\nWith Hotwire, you can see a grouping of three hotels you know you will stay at. That feature is called “Pricebreakers” for Priceline.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPriceline has a modest grouping of filters, including resort themes, free cancellation, star rating, brand names, and amenities like airport shuttles, free breakfast, spas, and more.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight has carved out a niche as the place to find a quick, last-minute hotel room. In fact, if you're looking to book with Hotel Tonight for a trip five months from now, you're out of luck! They only offer rooms four months away and sooner.\\nTheir website is extremely simple. You select the day and city you want to stay in, and it presents you with some options and a map. No other filters or frills are available.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHotel Tonight rates are only bookable with Hotel Tonight, meaning your booking options are more limited. But especially when you're searching for a last-minute deal, we always recommend stopping in to Hotel Tonight to see what they have for deals.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nYou may know Expedia from its television ads or, frankly, all types of ads. Expedia markets itself well and gets in front of a lot of potential travelers.\\nIt offers a long, long list of search filters to help travelers narrow down their hotel stay options.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExpedia rates are only bookable through Expedia, but the website's large network of properties can still yield good deals.\\nExpedia is also a way many travelers book flights and rental cars, too, meaning it can be a one-stop shop for your next vacation if you don't want to book directly with the airline, hotel, or rental car company.\\nOne thing to note: Expedia's rewards program recently merged with Hotels.com and vacation rental platform Vrbo into a single loyalty program called One Key.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you visit Travelocity and think it looks awfully familiar to Expedia, you're right! The two hotel booking websites are, in fact, one and the same. Expedia owns Travelocity, and their searches are almost identical (as you can see in this screenshot and the one above).\\nTravelocity also offers a long list of filters to help you narrow down your options, just like Expedia.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTravelocity is also similar to Expedia in that you can only book rates through their own site, so you don't get the option to book elsewhere. Like Expedia, Travelocity can help you book flights and rental cars to round out your trip.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nTrivago is another great hotel booking tool, as it compares sites like Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Priceline, and more than 100 more. It is not, however, a hotel booking website. Trivago Book & Go is its booking subsidiary, but the website takes you to an entirely different reservation site to make the purchase.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou cannot book directly with Trivago – it's simply a search engine for other booking sites, including its own. But it is a powerful tool to find those great deals, even if its list of search filters is pretty limited. If you know what hotel you want and just need to find the best rate at it, Trivago is a helpful spot to start.\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFor American Express cardholders, the Amex Travel Portal is another very handy tool for booking your next hotel stay.\\nJust as with other credit card companies, you can use your American Express Membership Rewards points or use cash to book your hotel stays. With the right credit card, you can earn up to 5x points per dollar you spend.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBut the standout feature of American Express's travel portal is reserved for cardholders with the *amex platinum*.\\xa0That unlocks access to Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts\\xa0(FHR) program, a collection of luxury properties across the world that also comes with a handful of special perks,\\xa0along with the slightly-less-luxurious-but-still-excellent\\xa0The Hotel Collection.\\nFHR perks include free room upgrades when available, free daily breakfast for two, an experience credit of $100 or more for dining or spa services, noon check-in when available, and guaranteed 4 p.m. checkout.\\nAnd now you’ve got more of a reason to us your Platinum Card through the Amex Travel portal. Each calendar year, you’ll have a $200 credit to use at either Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties. Just book via Amextravel.com, pay with your Platinum Card, and that $200 credit will kick in automatically. Hotel Collection properties require a two-night minimum stay to trigger the credit.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAmerican Express also offers Hilton, Marriott Bonvoy, and Choice Hotels as Amex transfer partners, which is a decent list if you'd rather use points.\\xa0The Amex Travel Portal also has a long list of search filters compared to Chase and Capital One, letting travelers filter by neighborhood and a long list of amenities.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nIf you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, it might be worth searching the Chase Travel portal when you're looking for hotel rooms.\\nThe portal offers a long list of hotels all over the world, and gives you the chance to use your Chase points to book the rooms … for some extra value. With the *chase sapphire preferred*, every point is worth 1.25 cents booking through Chase Travel. With the *chase sapphire reserve*\\xa0that rises to 1.5 cents apiece.\\nYou can also pay cash for the rooms at the listed price and earn up to 10x Chase points for every dollar you spend, meaning you'll have more Ultimate Rewards points in the bank for your next booking.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhen using the Chase Travel portal with a Sapphire Preferred card, you also get a $50 hotel annual credit. If you hold the Sapphire Reserve card, you get a $300 annual travel credit when you book hotels … or any travel, including flights, rental cars, or even parking fees.\\nOn the flip side, you could do even better by instead using Chase transfer partners to book your hotels. Our favorite, World of Hyatt, is a 1 to 1 partner for Chase points, giving you access to hundreds of properties around the world at extremely reasonable rates. Whether you're booking a few days at the Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic or are booking a far-flung stay at the Park Hyatt Zanzibar in Tanzania, your Chase points can go further.\\xa0Chase points can also be transferred to IHG and Marriott Bonvoy.\\nThe Chase Travel portal has a decent number of filters to help you refine your search.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nCapital One also has a travel portal for travelers with Capital One credit cards. Like the other credit card travel portals, however, you have to be a cardholder to book through this site.\\nMaybe the best part of the Capital One Travel portal is that cardholders with the *venture x* get 10 points for every dollar spent on hotels, helping you earn faster so you can burn more points later. Cardholders with the *capital one venture card* earn 5x points per dollar on hotels booked through the portal.\\nIf you'd rather use your Capital One miles, you can book hotels through the portal and get 1 cent apiece … or, better yet, just charge the expense to your Capital One card and use miles to remove the purchase from your statement. Either way, a $250 hotel stay would run you 25,000 miles.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWith the Venture X card,\\xa0you also get a $300 annual travel credit that can be used on any purchases made through the Capital One Travel portal. But Capital One's travel portal has a relatively small list of filters for searching, meaning travelers might have to do some of their own research on properties. And in our experience, it can be hard to find the properties you want.\\nOverall, Capital One miles are very easy to earn, making this portal a good way to book hotels with either points or cash.\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes, skipping the hotel altogether is the best way to book cheap lodging for your vacation. If a vacation rental is more your speed, there are two heavy hitters you should check first: Airbnb and Vrbo.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRead next:\\xa05 Steps to Find the Best Airbnb, No Matter Where You're Heading\\nVacation rentals are great for a few reasons. For one, they can be a saving grace when hotel rates are too high. Often, you can find better value booking an entire apartment than you can booking a tiny hotel room.\\xa0Plus, if you're traveling with a group, Airbnbs can help you stay together in a place with a shared kitchen and living spaces.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf something like that is more your speed, then use both Vrbo and Airbnb to start your search. Both websites operate similarly and can be searched with a long list of filters and using the map.\\nVacation rental websites like these are a great way to find a special, unique stay as well. Want something with a little bit of charm instead of a sterile hotel room? Live in someone's home!\\n\\xa0\\nPros\\nCons\\n\\xa0\\nFinding the best hotel booking site and the sweetest hotel deals doesn't have to be stressful. A single best website to book hotels doesn't truly exist, but there are tons of great accommodation booking sites that could lead you right to the perfect place to stay on your next trip.\\nThe best hotel deals can be found at any of these 17 hotel reservation websites… plus a few more!

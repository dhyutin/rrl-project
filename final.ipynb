    "upon arrival to the room it looked like it had been chewed up by a pack of dogs. seeing as we had a dog of our own that had opted for a pet stay we decided to overlook that, however immediately we noticed the air conditioner was not cooling the room. we turned it down to 62 and waited a while.. meanwhile i noticed the giant sheets of particle board under the mattresses instead of box springs. also worth noting that though they had noted they were going under lobby renovations we kept having fire drills. ultimately the room would not cool down and we asked to be moved to a different room and we're told that there was no rooms available and they would send up a technician. technician came around 10pm and confirmed the ac was blowing at 61 and that the room would cool down within an hour. at 7:00 a.m. the next morning the room had not cooled down 1°, still at 72. we couldn't sleep at all as we both run hot and prefer temperatures in the 66 to 68 range for sleeping. we only stayed one night of our two nights and i opted for somewhere that wasn't a complete and total waste of time and money.\n",

    "this hotel is apparently remodeling several floors. we were assigned to an older floor and arrived to a hot/stuffy room. upon returning from sightseeing and dinner, the a/c still didn't work though maintenance had reported it as fixed. the front desk was able to provide us a fan that made sleeping that night more bearable. after 2nd day full of activities in chicago, arrived back to hotel around midnight to discover a/c still not working. after more late night maintenance visits, staff determined a/c could not be fixed that night. thankfully around 1 am we were moved to an upgraded room at no additional charge with working a/c!! the night manager also removed room charges for that 1st night's stay which we appreciated. the front desk, maintenance, breakfast staffs, etc. were all very nice and courteous. the morning of our last vacation day, we again headed to chicago before housekeeping serviced our room. carelessly, i left my 2nd phone laying on the desk. when we returned to the room that evening, the room had been serviced, but my phone was no longer on the desk. unfortunately i didn't realize the phone was really missing until we checked out the next morning, returned home and was unable to find it in any of our bags, etc. i called the front desk and was told housekeeping did not report any found items left behind. looking back, none of us saw the phone sitting on the desk after returning from chicago (that third sunday night of our stay). i told the front desk i felt confident that it disappeared during our stay and that i would be leaving a review to reflect that. i guess i should have tried leaving it in the safe....but the safe in our 1st room didn't work anyway so i guess we didn't think about trying to use the safe in our 2nd room. i am so disappointed as i had been very happy with how friendly staff had been. i really miss my phone and would like to know where it went.\n",
